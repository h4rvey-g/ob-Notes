MALLIN Introduction Hello and welcome to the Introduction to Bedside Ultrasound digital textbook.  This project is the product of an exceptional amount of hard work from a lot of people over a long period of time.   We are  super excited about this book, but let's face it, we're always super excited. Over the last couple of years,  we've worked on several projects,  such as The Ultrasound Podcast, The One Minute Ultrasound iPhone App, Castlefest, and Sonocloud. Of all these endeavors, we're probably the most proud of this book because of all the incredible people we were able to collaborate with in its production.  The authors are people who we sincerely look up to in the ultrasound world, and we're honored to be able to work with these legends.   It takes a true team to produce an interactive, digital textbook, and working with everyone involved has been amazingly rewarding.  We want to espe- cially thank our technical director and designer, Jody, our editor, Brittany, and medical illustrator, Ryan.  This certainly wouldn't have been possible with- out them.   Lastly, we’d like to say thanks to you, the reader, for downloading the book.  We hope that it enhances your medical practice and makes a difference in the lives and care of your patients. Now, before you get started, please click above to hear an audio message from us, and, most importantly, to learn how you can help make this book even more awesome.  CHAPTER 1 FAST/EFAST Phil Craven MD, Mike Mallin, MD SUMMARY The FAST exam was ﬁrst used in trauma in the 1970s FAST is  essential  in the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol FAST has replaced DPL as the diagnostic modality of choice in evaluating for abdominal hemorrhage SECTION 1 Introduction A common occurrence in the emergency department is the patient who has trauma that is not readily apparent on the initial physical exam. Further, the presence of distracting injuries, altered mental status, or intoxication may signiﬁcantly reduce the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of physical examination ﬁndings. 1 Due to the inadequa- cies of the physical examination in the trauma patient, further diag- nostic studies are indicated in both blunt and penetrating trauma. Ob- viously, a hypotensive patient with penetrating abdominal trauma re- quires an emergent exploratory laparotomy (ex-lap); however, a pa- tient with blunt trauma is another matter. In the past, Diagnostic Peri- toneal Lavage (DPL) was employed as a method of determining if intra-abdominal bleeding was occurring, and carried a sensitivity of 87-96% for intraperitoneal hemorrhage.2-4 It should be noted that up to one third of trauma patients with a positive DPL will have a nega- tive exploratory laparotomy, as there is a high false positive rate with DPL.5 As little as 20mL of blood mixed with the standard liter of peritoneal lavage ﬂuid will result in a positive DPL.6 In addition, DPL may carry a higher false positive rate if pelvic fractures are present due to accidental sampling of a retroperitoneal hematoma. 7-9 \t In the last 30 years, ultrasound has emerged as an important diagnostic modality in trauma patients. German and Japanese physi- cians have reportedly been using ultrasound in this setting since the early 1970s10; however, it did not gain favor in the United States un- til the 1980s.11 Currently, ultrasound and the Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) exam12 are employed as part of the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol developed by the American College of Surgeons. 3 SUMMARY FAST can be performed in less than 3 min. Views include the RUQ, Subxiphoid, LUQ, and Pelvic. FAST exam can before performed with the curvelinear or the phased array probe. SECTION 2 FAST Exam INDICATIONS FOR FAST EXAM FAST is the imaging modality of choice in the ATLS protocol, per- formed immediately after the primary survey. The purpose of the FAST is to ultrasonographically evaluate the pericardial and perito- neal spfaces for the presence or absence of blood. In essence, the FAST exam has replaced the DPL in this role. It is less invasive, safe in pregnancy, and does not carry any of the complications associ- ated with DPL. The FAST exam has a sensitivity range of 73-88% and speciﬁcity of 98-100%, depending on the operator.13-15 In the hands of an experienced operator, the speciﬁcity approaches 100%. How- ever, because of the range of accuracy, it must be understood that the FAST exam is a screening test that helps determine if the unstable patient has an intra-abdominal injury requiring an emergent explora- tory laparotomy. It assesses if there is ﬂuid in the abdomen, most likely blood in the setting of trauma, but the FAST cannot directly as- 4 MOVIE 1.1 - FAST How-to sess organs or hollow viscus. This results in the high speciﬁcity and slightly lower sensitivity because FAST indirectly evaluates organs and bowel. Ultrasound cannot replace computed tomography (CT), which has much better accuracy with solid organ and bowel injuries. The advantage of the FAST is that it can be reliably performed in fewer than 3 mins,16 and so it is ideal for decision making during a trauma situation. If a patient is unstable and has a positive FAST, an emergent ex-lap is required. An unstable patient with a negative FAST should prompt a search for other causes of hypotension.\t The FAST exam was initially designed for use in the trauma setting; however, there are other situations in which the FAST exam is useful. Speciﬁc indications for a FAST exam include: •Blunt and penetrating cardiac trauma: early bedside ultra- sound is indicated, and early diagnosis of a pericardial effu- sion signiﬁcantly improves mortality in both penetrating17 and blunt 18 cardiac trauma •Blunt abdominal trauma •Penetrating abdominal trauma: although the FAST exam was initially designed for blunt abdominal trauma, it appears to be useful in penetrating trauma. FAST has a speciﬁcity of 94% and sensitivity of 46% in this setting,19 and so it is still helpful in de- termining management. A positive result is a strong predictor that the patient requires an ex-lap.20-21 The low sensitivity high- lights that ultrasound cannot directly evaluate bowel and organ injury, which are most likely in penetrating trauma. •Ectopic pregnancy: a FAST exam should be performed on every unstable patient with a possible ectopic pregnancy. Free ﬂuid in the abdomen is highly suggestive of an ectopic.  A mod- erate amount of free pelvic ﬂuid has an 86% likelihood of be- ing from an ectopic, and hepatorenal free ﬂuid carried nearly a 100% risk of ectopic in one study.22 In fact, free ﬂuid may be the only abnormal sonographic ﬁnding in roughly 15% of ec- topic pregnancies. 23 In a study of 242 women with suspected ectopic pregnancy, emergency medicine physicians identiﬁed 10 patients with ﬂuid in Morison’s pouch on FAST, 9 of which went to the OR. This resulted in a positive likelihood ratio of 112. 24 Performing a FAST exam can signiﬁcantly reduce the time to diagnosis and treatment of ectopic pregnancy. 25 •A FAST exam is indicated in any clinical situation in which a clinician is concerned for intra-abdominal free ﬂuid or hemor- rhage. This could include liver failure with ascites, a ruptured ovarian cyst, undifferentiated hypotension, etc. (See RUSH Chapter). •Ultrasound is indicated in blunt or penetrating chest trauma in order to evaluate for hemo- or pneumothorax. Evaluation of the thorax is part of the extended FAST (EFAST), and will be further discussed at the end of the chapter. 5 ANATOMICAL CONSIDERATIONS The FAST exam is performed with the patient lying supine. In this anatomic position, the hepatorenal space (Morison’s pouch), sple- norenal recess, and pelvis are the most dependent portions of the peritoneal cavity. Any ﬂuid present will most likely accumulate ﬁrst in Morison’s pouch, with any overﬂow travelling down the right para- colic gutter into the rectovesicular space in males and recto-uterine space (Pouch of Douglas) in females. 26 Similarly, ﬂuid in the splenore- nal recess may overﬂow and travel down the left paracolic gutter into the pelvis or over to Morison’s pouch. The FAST exam is com- pleted by imaging these three areas of the abdomen for free ﬂuid and obtaining a subcostal view of the heart to evaluate for a pericar- dial effusion. Fluid will appear as a black stripe within the image. Ul- trasound can reliably detect 200mL of ﬂuid in the peritoneum, 27 with some evidence showing that as little as 100mL can be detected de- pending on the operator. 28 There is some evidence that smaller amounts of ﬂuid can be reliably detected if the patient is placed in the Trendelenburg position.29 PROBE SELECTION The 4 views of the FAST exam: Morison’s Pouch (RUQ), the splenore- nal recess (LUQ), the pelvis (suprapubic area) and the pericardium (subxiphoid)(Gallery 1.1). Probe Selection: The 3.5MHZ phased array probe can be used, as the transducer can ﬁt into an intercostal space and some feel that im- ages may be more easily obtained without an obscuring rib shadow. A curvilinear probe may also be used, and will carry its own advan- tages and disadvantages. The advantage is that a wider and clearer image will be obtained, as well as better tissue penetration, but the likelihood of an obscuring rib shadow is higher. ULTRASOUND VIEWS AND NORMAL/ABNORMAL FINDINGS Pericardial View The subxiphoid view is obtained by placing the probe just inferior to the xiphoid and directing it towards the patient's head. The probe marker should be aiming towards the patient’s right side. Occasion- ally, the probe may need to be directed towards the patient’s left shoulder. 6 Morison’s Pouch GALLERY 1.1 Four Views of Fast Exam The liver is used as the acoustic window for this image, thus the probe may need to be slightly to the right of the patient’s xiphoid. It is important to ﬂatten the probe down so that it is roughly ﬂat on the abdominal wall. To do this, the probe is held with a pincer grasp so that the operator’s hand does not interfere with ﬂattening the probe. (Gallery 1.2) The resulting image should be a coronal section of the heart in which all 4 chambers are visualized. (Gallery 1.3 and Movie 1.2) This view can be used to assess chamber size and global cardiac function; however, the main point of interest is to evaluate the pericar- dium for evidence of effusion. 7 GALLERY 1.2 Pericardial View GALLERY 1.3 All Four Chambers MOVIE 1.2 - Normal subxiphoid view A normal pericardium should consist of a single hyperechoic (white) line surrounding the heart. (Movie 1.3) A pericardial effusion is pre- sent if ﬂuid accumulates within the potential space between the peri- cardium and the cardiac muscle. On ultrasound, this will appear as a black (anechoic) stripe. (Movie 1.4) The most feared complication of a pericardial effusion is tamponade, which may develop depending on the amount of ﬂuid and rate of ac- cumulation. Effusions may be acute or chronic, but must be assumed acute in the setting of trauma and hypotension. A small amount of ﬂuid (50-100cc) may cause tamponade if it accumulates rapidly enough. 30 Recall that tamponade physiology occurs if the pressure in the pericardial sac exceeds the right atrial or ventricular ﬁlling pres- sures. If this occurs, the cardiac chambers are unable to ﬁll, and so ejection fraction and cardiac output are reduced. Clinically this is manifested as JVD, tachycardia, hypotension, mufﬂed heart sounds, etc. There are speciﬁc ﬁndings on ultrasound, such as right atrium or right ventricular collapse, indicative of tamponade physiology (Link to Cardiac Chapter). However, this assessment can be challenging. 8 MOVIE 1.3 - Normal pericardium MOVIE 1.4 - Pericardial effusion MOVIE 1.5 Tamponade with RA Collapse In the trauma setting, if a patient is hemodynamically unstable and has a pericardial effusion on ultrasound, the patient must be pre- sumed to have cardiac tamponade until proven otherwise. Morison’s Pouch (RUQ View) The probe is placed at the mid-axillary line between the 8th and 11th ribs. The probe should be placed in an oblique angle, such that it will ﬁt into an intercostal space, with the probe marker pointing cephalad towards the posterior right axilla. The resulting image should include the liver and right kidney interface and superior kidney and dia- phragm interface. (Gallery 1.4) US appearance of normal FAST The point of interest in this image (Gallery 1.5) is the interface be- tween the liver-kidney and between the liver-diaphragm. The liver and kidney interface represents Morison’s Pouch. Morison’s Pouch is a potential space, and so on a normal FAST exam, it should not con- tain any ﬂuid. If ﬂuid were to accumulate within Morison’s Pouch, a black stripe would be visualized, appearing to separate the interface between the liver and kidney. The length (in cm) of the anechoic stripe in Morison’s Pouch may correlate with the volume of ﬂuid within the peritoneum. A 0.5cm stripe corresponds with roughly 500cc ﬂuid. 10 A 1.0cm stripe correlates with 1000cc ﬂuid.31 Gallery 1.5, image 3, shows roughly 500-1000cc ﬂuid in Morison’s Pouch. A positive FAST can also occur if there is ﬂuid above the liver and un- der the diaphragm. In the following image (Gallery 1.5), the liver and hyperechoic diaphragm can be seen with a thin stripe of black ﬂuid separating the two. (Movie 1.7) 9 MOVIE 1.6 Tamponade with RV Collapse The probe should be placed in an oblique angle, such that it will fit into an intercostal space, with the probe marker pointing caudally towards the posterior right axilla. GALLERY 1.4 - RUQ view Splenorenal Recess (LUQ View) This view is often the most difﬁcult view to obtain during the FAST exam. In the RUQ view, the liver acts as a large acoustic window. In the LUQ, the spleen is much smaller and so provides a smaller win- dow. The spleen is a very posterior structure, thus the best approach to obtain a view is to place the probe at the posterior axillary line. This is often described as the operator placing their knuckles on the bed, implying a more posterior approach. In this fashion the stomach is avoided and the posterior spleen is used as an acoustic window to view the kidney. The next step is to lower the sensing end of the 10 The liver and kidney interface represents Mori- son’s Pouch. GALLERY 1.5 MOVIE 1.7 - If fluid were to accumulate within Morison’s Pouch, a black stripe would be visualized. To obtain the LUQ window the operator should start with the hand on the bed. GALLERY 1.6 - Obtaining LUQ View probe down until it comes into contact with the patient. (Gallery 1.6) The result is that the transducer will come into contact with the patient at the posterior axillary line, at the 6th-9th rib interspaces. The probe may be rotated slightly clockwise so that the probe ﬁts obliquely within a rib interspace. In this position, the probe will be lined up through the spleen and kid- ney to obtain the necessary image. Once properly aligned, the ultra- sound view should contain diaphragm, spleen and left kidney. If these are not visible, the probe should be kept in the same align- ment, and with the scanning hand still touching the gurney, move the probe caudally up 1-2 rib interspaces or have the patient inspire. The anatomy of a normal LUQ view will appear as: 11 IMAGE 1.1 - Normal RUQ View In the normal FAST, the spleen-renal and spleen- diaphragm interfaces will both be flush without an anechoic stripe. GALLERY 1.7 One Minute Ultrasound FAST Demonstration The point of interest in the LUQ is the area surrounding the spleen. Fluid may accumulate between the spleen and kidney or between the spleen and diaphragm. In the normal FAST (Movie 1.8), the spleen- renal and spleen-diaphragm interfaces will both be ﬂush without an anechoic stripe. If ﬂuid is present, the interfaces will be widened, and a black stripe of ﬂuid will separate the spleen and kidney or the spleen and diaphragm. (Gallery 1.7 and Movie 1.9) 12 MOVIE 1.8 - Normal FAST MOVIE 1.9 - Positive LUQ view Pelvic Views Typically this view is the easiest to obtain in the FAST, and will evalu- ate for ﬂuid in the pelvis. Imaging the pelvis is different from the other views of the FAST in that the pelvis is imaged in 2 different planes. To obtain the longitudinal view, the probe is placed 2cm su- perior to the symphysis pubis, at midline, with the probe marker pointing towards the patient’s head. (Gallery 1.8) Notice that the 13 The probe is placed 2cm superior to the symphysis pubis, at midline, with the probe marker pointing towards the pa- tient’s head. GALLERY 1.8 - Pelvic View GALLERY 1.9 - Male anatomy - Sagittal MOVIE 1.10 - Male Anatomy - Sagittal prostate is at the caudal end of the bladder. (Gallery 1.9 and Movie 1.10) The prostate is an extra-peritoneal organ, and so its location demarcates the end of the inferior peritoneum. In the male, free ﬂuid will collect posterior and superior to the blad- der in the rectovesicular space. Because the prostate demarcates the inferior peritoneum, ﬂuid will accumulate superior to it and the blad- der. In the following, (Movie 1.11) note that the black peritoneal ﬂuid begins at the superior bladder and tracks down to the prostate. 14 MOVIE 1.11 - Note that the black peritoneal fluid be- gins at the superior bladder and tracks down to the pros- tate. To obtain the transverse view, the probe marker is simply turned 90 counterclockwise and oriented toward the pa- tient’s right. GALLERY 1.10 The probe is then rocked cranially so that the prostate is no longer seen and the rectovesicular space behind the bladder can be imaged. MOVIE 1.12 To obtain the transverse view, the probe marker is simply turned 90° counterclockwise and oriented toward the patient’s right. (Gallery 1. 1 0 )  One pitfall with imaging in the transverse plane in the male is that the sonographer may angle the probe too far caudally (towards the feet) and image the bladder and prostate. As the prostate is an extra-peritoneal organ, the peritoneum is not being imaged, and so the probe must be angled more cranially in order to assess for intrap- eritoneal ﬂuid. In the following video, note that the bladder and pros- tate are imaged initially, and the probe is then rocked cranially so that the prostate is no longer seen and the rectovesicular space be- hind the bladder can be imaged. (Movie 1.12) In the female, the uterus will be visible on the pelvic view of the FAST. The probe is placed in the same suprapubic position as de- scribed above, with the uterus visualized on the resulting image. In the female, the most de- pendent portion of the peritoneum is the Pouch of Douglas (rectouterine pouch), and so ﬂuid is most likely to accumu- late there.26 In the result- ing longitudinal video, the bladder can be seen at the top of the image, with the uterus posterior and cephalad. (Movie 1.13) The following videos show ﬂuid anterior and posterior to the uterus in the Pouch of Douglas. The anechoic area anterior to the uterus represents a pocket of pelvic free ﬂuid. The bladder can be visual- ized to the right of the screen and is incompletely seen. (Movies 1.14 and 1.15) Again, the probe is turned 90° counterclockwise so that the probe marker is facing towards the patient’s right side. This view will show transverse cuts of the bladder and uterus. (Image 1.2) Note that in the transverse plane, the uterus may appear hyperechoic.(Movie 1.17) Here, free pelvic ﬂuid is seen in transverse orientation. (Movie 1.16) 15 GALLERY 1.11 IMAGE 1.2 16 The bladder can be seen at the top of the image, with the uterus posterior and cephalad.

MOVIE 1.17 Summary The extended fast includes evaluation of the hemithoraces. The linear probe is used to evaluate for \"lung sliding\" and pneu- mothorax. Directing the abdominal probe cranially from the RUQ and LUQ windows allows for evaluation for pleural ﬂuid/ hemothorax. SECTION 3 Extended FAST (EFAST) In recent years, the extended FAST exam has gained favor in the trauma bay. In addition to the traditional FAST views, the EFAST also images the hemithoraces for pneumo- or hemothorax. In the past, the trauma survey relied on physical exam ﬁndings and portable chest radiography (PCXR) to detect these. As discussed previously, physi- cal exam ﬁndings are unreliable and breath sounds can often be difﬁ- cult to auscultate while in a busy trauma bay. For pneumothorax, PCXR carries a sensitivity of 48.8-75.5% and speciﬁcity of 100%, whereas ultrasound is 92-98.1% sensitive and 99.4% speciﬁc.32-34 In addition, bedside ultrasound has the advantage of a speedier diag- nosis time of 2.9 minutes versus 19.9 for PCXR. 35 Ultrasound imaging of the pleural-diaphragmatic interface has been shown to be superior to PCXR in detection of hemothorax or pleural effusion. An upright chest x-ray can detect up to a minimum of 50- 100mL pleural ﬂuid. 35 However, a supine chest x-ray, which is typi- cally done in the trauma bay, requires much more ﬂuid accumulation before radiographic changes are seen. A pleural ﬂuid amount of 175mL is required before blunting of the costophrenic angle will be seen on supine PCXR.36-38 Supine ultrasonography of the pleural spaces can detect as little as 20mL of pleural ﬂuid. 39 Ultrasound is more sensitive than PXCR for hemothorax. (See lung chapter) 17 ULTRASOUND VIEWS AND NORMAL/ABNORMAL FINDINGS Pneumothorax Evaluation for pneumothorax relies on imaging of the sliding be- tween the visceral and parietal pleura. In a patient without pneu- mothorax, these two layers will be in direct contact with each other. With respiration, sliding of these two layers can be seen on ultra- sound. To perform this examination, a high frequency linear probe is typically used. However, a curvilinear or phased array probe may also be used. The biggest pitfall with this examination is having the image depth set too deep. Unless the patient is extremely obese, a maximum image depth of 4cm should be used. With the patient in the supine position, the probe is placed in the longitudinal position in the 3 rd to 4th intercostal space at the midclavicular line on the right and the anterior axillary line on the left. The probe marker should be facing towards the patients head. In this orientation, the ribs and rib shadows can be used as a landmark to ﬁnd the pleura. The operator should then slide the probe longitudinally until one rib is seen on ei- ther side of the image. Immediately posterior to the ribs will be the pleural line. (Gallery 1.12) In real time, and with normal respirations, the physiologic sliding be- tween the pleura can be visualized. It appears as though it is shim- mering and is sometimes referred to as ants marching. (Movie 1.19) The motion of this sliding artifact is the most common normal sign on ultrasound. Normal lung sliding means that there is no air between the pleura and so excludes pneumothorax. 41-42 Ultrasound M-mode can also be applied and will show a characteristic pattern in that granular artifacts will be seen below the bright pleural line. This is termed the seashore sign and represents normal pleural sliding. Another sign of a normally functioning lung is the comet tail artifact, or B-line. This is a type of reverberation artifact that arises from dis- tended water-ﬁlled interlobular septae under the visceral pleura. As the comet tail is caused by visualization of structures deep to the vis- ceral pleura, they may only be seen if no pneumothorax is present. Comet tail artifact may not always be present, but carries a sensitiv- 18 The probe is placed in the longitudinal position in the 3rd to 4th intercostal space. GALLERY 1.12 ity of 100% for ruling out pneumothorax when seen.43 The following video shows comet tail artifacts intermittently with respirations. (Movie 1.20) If a pneumothorax is present, then no lung sliding will be visualized. (Movies 1.21 and 1.22) As discussed above, the absence of lung slid- ing is 99.4% speciﬁc for pneumothorax. 32-34 19 In real time, and with normal respirations, the physiologic sliding between the pleura can be visualized. It appears as though it is shimmering and is sometimes referred to as ants marching. MOVIE 1.18 MOVIE 1.19 Comet tail artifacts MOVIE 1.20 - Pneumothorax MOVIE 1.21 Pneumothorax A pneumothorax will show a characteristic appearance on M-mode resulting from reverberation artifact of the ultrasound waves between the pleura and air. Parallel horizontal lines will be seen throughout the image that represents pneumothorax and is called the barcode sign or stratosphere sign. (Gallery 1.13) The lung point can be used to estimate the size of a pneumothorax. The lung point is the transition between expanded and collapsed lung. The lung point can be difﬁcult to ﬁnd; however, when present, it is 100% speciﬁc for pneumothorax. 44 The lung point is the speciﬁc point at which the shimmering or ants marching will cease and no pleural sliding will be seen thereafter. In Gallery 1.14, comet tails and sliding artifact can be seen; however, a point is seen thereafter in which there are no comet tails. Hemothorax Evaluation for hemothorax uses the same probe and probe position as when assessing Morison’s Pouch and the splenorenal recess. Es- sentially, the normal FAST view of the LUQ and RUQ are obtained then the probe is slid 1-2 rib interspaces up, or simply angled cepha- lad. In this position, the hyperechoic diaphragm can be seen to overly either the spleen or liver. (Gallery 1.14) 20 Barcode sign or stratosphere sign. GALLERY 1.13 In this position, the hyperechoic diaphragm can be seen to overly either the spleen or liver. GALLERY 1.14 Some authors suggest using an anterior, subcostal approach, using the liver as an acoustic window into the hemothorax. The presence of ﬂuid in the pleural space can be seen as black ﬂuid superior to dia- phragm. (Movies 1.22 and 1.23) SUMMARY In summary, ultrasound has become a reliable and important tool in evaluating the patient with thoracoabdominal trauma. The FAST and EFAST can easily be performed at the bedside and dramatically de- crease time to diagnosis and length of stay in the emergency depart- ment. These exams can also be used in any non-trauma situation when there is suspected pneumothorax, pleural, pericardial, or peri- toneal ﬂuid. Tell everyone that you just ﬁnished another chapter!

Bedside echocardiography can help clinicians risk- stratify patients and further guide resuscitative efforts.12-13 At times, the information and disorders noted on bedside cardiac ultrasound are vast and may surpass what performing clinicians are able to ap- preciate and integrate. As per the American Society of Echocardi- ography (ASE) – American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) Consensus Statement, the ability to assess global left ventricular func- tion, to detect pericardial effusions, and to assess for right heart dila- tation (chamber sizes) are within the scope of clinicians and can help answer critical patient management questions. 8 27 MOVIE 2.2 - Aortic Regurgitation BASIC VIEWS: Subxiphoid/subcostal Parasternal Long Axis Parasternal Short Axis Apical Tip: Left Lateral Decubitus position will improve view in parasternal and apical views. SECTION 2 Technique The heart lies obliquely in the chest with the apex pointing to- wards the left hip and the base of the heart oriented towards the right shoulder (Image 2.1). The heart is imaged from multiple dif- ferent views and the ﬁndings seen on one view should be con- ﬁrmed or refuted with additional views. A 2 to 5-MHz phased ar- ray probe is used when attempt- ing to obtain acoustic windows of the heart, as the smaller footprint (ﬂat square face) more easily ﬁts in between the ribs (Image 2.2). 28 IMAGE 2.1 IMAGE 2.2 - Parasternal Long Axis View There are four basic car di ac v i e ws: p a r a s t e r n a l l o n g a x i s , p a ra s t e r n a l short axis, apical 4- chamber, and subcos- tal. If possible, the patient should be rolled into the left lat- eral decubitus posi- tion, as this brings the heart closer to the anterior chest wall and improves imaging (Image 2.3). The parasternal long axis (PSLA) view is obtained by placing the probe to the left of the sternum with the probe marker pointing towards the patient’s right shoulder. The probe is then gently dragged over the chest wall from the 2nd to 5th intercostal spaces, searching for the best acoustic window (Movie 2.3). The PSLA view is consistently ob- tainable and provides an excellent view of the left atrium (LA), left ventricle (LV), and aortic outﬂow tract. Once the parasternal long axis view is acquired, the probe can then be rotated clockwise 90° with the probe marker pointing towards the patient’s left shoulder to obtain the parasternal short axis (PSSA) view (Movie 2.4). The PSSA view is an ideal view for assessing global LV function. The api- 29 MOVIE 2.4 MOVIE 2.3 IMAGE 2.3 cal 4-chamber (A4C) view is obtained by placing the probe inferior and lateral to the left nipple in men or under the left breast in women. The probe marker is pointed towards the patient’s left hip and the face of the transducer is angled up towards the base of the heart (Movie 2.5). The A4C view is often the most difﬁcult view to acquire but offers valuable information about all four chambers and their relative sizes. The subcostal view is obtained by placing the probe just below the xiphoid process with the probe marker pointing towards the patient’s left hip. The subxiphoid view uses the left lobe of the liver as an acoustic window and involves angling the face of the probe up from the abdomen and into the left chest. Placing the hand over the probe, as opposed to holding the probe like a pencil, as in other views, allows for the requisite angling of the probe where it is almost ﬂat against the abdominal wall (Movie 2.6).

IMAGE 2.4 31 SUMMARY Global left ventricular function can be accurately assessed by emergency physicians. Scenarios where LVF may be useful: Chest pain Dyspnea Unexplained hypotension Cardiac arrest SECTION 3 Left Ventricular Function Assessment of global left ventricular function is a fundamental appli- cation of basic bedside echocardiography and helps predict clinical outcomes for a variety of disease states. The ability to assess a pa- tient’s overall left ventricular function — from cardiac standstill (Movie 2.7) to a hyperdynamic ejection fraction (Movie 2.8) — allows clini- cians to better manage patients who present with chest pain, dysp- nea, unexplained hypotension or cardiac arrest. 14-15 32 MOVIE 2.7 MOVIE 2.8 While regional wall motion abnormalities and quantitative measure- ments may be beyond the scope of some clinicians, the visual (quali- tative) estimate of global left ventricular systolic function is not. 8,16 Assessment of systolic function is derived from the visual assessment of endocardial border excursion and myocardial thickening, as seen from multiple views (Movies 2.9-2.12). 33 MOVIE 2.9 - Parasternal long MOVIE 2.10 - Parasternal short MOVIE 2.11 - Apical 4 MOVIE 2.12 - Subxiphoid 4 Classiﬁcation of LV function can be simpliﬁed into the following: se- verely depressed (EF < 30%), mild-moderately depressed (EF 30- 55%), and normal (EF > 55%). 15 (Movies 2.13-2.16) 34 MOVIE 2.13 - Severely Depressed EF MOVIE 2.14 - Severely Depressed EF MOVIE 2.15 - Moderately Depressed EF MOVIE 2.16 - Normal EF Ejection fractions in excess of 70% are considered hyperdynamic, which may appear as near obliteration of the ventricular cavity dur- ing systole (Movie 2.17). The ﬁnding of a hyperdynamic heart may suggest hypovolemia or vasodilation and should prompt the clinician to initiate volume resusci- tation. It is important, however, to differentiate a hyperdynamic heart from one that is tachycardic but with a normal EF% (Movie 2.18-2.19). With appropriate education and training, clinicians can differentiate between normal and severely depressed left ventricular systolic function similar to cardiologists. 15 Moore et al demonstrated that, with focused training, emergency physicians can accurately de- termine left ventricular function in hypotensive patients.15 35 MOVIE 2.17 - Hyperdynamic EF MOVIE 2.18 - Hyperdynamic EF MOVIE 2.19 - Hyperdynamic EF Although this study showed good agreement between emergency physicians and cardiologists for patients with normal and severely de- pressed left ventricular function, emergency physicians had more trou- ble categorizing patients with moderately depressed LV function (Movie 2.20). This validates the ability of clinicians to identify ex- tremes of LV dysfunction, but underscores the need for clinicians to recognize their limitations and to obtain consultative studies when in- dicated. 36 MOVIE 2.20 One Minute Ultrasound EPSS Demonstration SUMMARY Ultrasound is an ideal modality for detecting pericardial effu- sions Tamponade is a clinical diagnosis that depends more on pres- sure and physiology than size of effusion Pericardial and pleural effusions can frequently be differenti- ated based on location of ﬂuid. SECTION 4 Pericardial Effusion Pericardial ﬂuid typically appears as an anechoic space between the epicardium and the pericardium (Image 2.5). Pericardial effusions are caused by a variety of disorders (infection, malignancy, connec- tive tissue disease, renal failure, trauma) and may also develop after cardiac surgery or invasive cardiac procedures (pacemaker place- ment, cardiac catheterization). Ultrasound is an ideal modality to as- sess for the presence of pericardial ﬂuid and its impact on right heart ﬁlling. 3,17,18 Pericardial effusions are not an uncommon diagnosis in patients presenting with dyspnea or hypotension.11,19 Although car- diac tamponade is largely a clinical diagnosis, bedside echocardi- ography may demonstrate ﬁndings suggestive of impending tampon- 37 IMAGE 2.5 ade prior to the development of physical examination ﬁndings and hemodynamic compromise. 20-22 The amount of ﬂuid required to im- pair ﬁlling and to cause circulatory failure depends on the rate of ac- cumulation. Pericardial effusions may be graded as: Small (<0.5cm) (Movies 2.21-2.22)  Moderate (0.5-2.0cm) (Movies 2.23-2.24)  Large (>2cm) (Movies 2.25-2.26)23-25 38 MOVIE 2.21 - Small Effusion MOVIE 2.22 - Small Effusion MOVIE 2.23 - Moderate Effusion MOVIE 2.24 - Moderate Effusion MOVIE 2.25 - Large Effusion MOVIE 2.26 - Large Effusion While large effusions are often circumferential, it is important to rec- ognize that effusions can be focal, organized, or loculated (Movies 2.27-2.28). A potential pitfall is differentiating between epicardial fat pads and true pericardial effusions. Epicardial fat pads are often visualized an- teriorly and are mostly hypoechoic in appearance but often have some echogenicity (Movie 2.29). 39 MOVIE 2.27 - Anterior effusion MOVIE 2.28 - Anterior effusion MOVIE 2.29 - Epicardial fat pad MOVIE 2.30 - RV collapse due to tamponade Numerous studies have demonstrated that emergency physician–per- formed emergency echocardiography has sensitivities approaching 100% for the detection of pericardial effusions.12,19,26 When com- pared with expert over-read of images, emergency physician–per- formed emergency echocardiography for effusion has a sensitivity of 96% to 100%, a speciﬁcity of 98% to 100%, a positive predictive value of 93% to 100%, and a negative predictive value of 99% to 100%. The echocardiographic ﬁndings consistent with cardiac tam- ponade include the following: right ventricular (RV) free wall inver- sion during ventricular diastole (the hallmark ﬁnding, Image 2.6 & Movies 2.30-2.31); right atrial inversion during ventricular systole (more common and one of the earliest ﬁndings); increased respira- tory variation of mitral or tricuspid inﬂow velocities (inspiratory de- creases of greater than 25% on mitral inﬂow or greater than 40% on tricuspid inﬂow); and a dilated inferior vena cava with decreased respirophasic variation (Movie 2.32).24-25, 27 It is important not to confuse ventricular or atrial systole with diastolic collapse. While large pleural effusions may be misinterpreted as peri- cardial effusions, the descending thoracic aorta can be used to differ- entiate the two diagnoses. Pleural effusions run posterior or lateral to the descending thoracic aorta, while pericardial effusions track an- teriorly or medially (Movies 2.33-2.34). 40 MOVIE 2.31 - RV Collapse MOVIE 2.32 - Plethoric IVC in Tamponade 41 IMAGE 2.6 - RV collapse on M-Mode - Tamponade MOVIE 2.33 - Right pleural and pericardial effusions MOVIE 2.34 - Left Pleural and pericardial effusions COMMON CAUSES OF RIGHT HEART DIL ATATION: PE RV infarction Pulmonary hypertension COPD Normal RV:LV ratio is 0.6:1.0 SECTION 5 Right Heart Dilatation Patients with right ventricular dysfunction can be difﬁcult to diagnose and challenging to manage. Patients with right heart failure may worsen with aggressive ﬂuid resuscitation, and identiﬁcation and re- versal of the etiology for RV dysfunction is key.28-29 The thin-walled right ventricle (RV) is extremely sensitive to load and, as such, small changes in pressure lead to large changes in volume. RV dilatation is the normal response to RV pressure or volume overload.24 While as- sessing for RV systolic dysfunction or for paradoxical septal motion (Movie 2.35) 42 MOVIE 2.35 - Parasternal Short with septal flattening can be challenging for many clinicians, assessing for RV dilatation (chamber size) may not be.8 Typically, the RV is smaller than the left ventricle, with an RV-to-LV ratio of 0.6:1.0 (Image 2.7). When the RV is noted to be equal in size to the LV, the RV is moder- ately dilated (Movie 2.36-2.37). 43 IMAGE 2.7 MOVIE 2.36 - RV dilation MOVIE 2.37 - RV dilation When the RV is larger than the LV, severe RV dilatation is present30 (Movie 2.38-2.41). The apical 4-chamber view is used to compare RV and LV sizes, and the relative sizes are compared at the tips of the atrioventricular valves in diastole. When RV dilatation is present, the RV apex is shifted closer to – or even encompasses – the LV apex. 25 In the appropriate clinical setting and when combined with other variables, RV dilatation may suggest RV outﬂow tract obstruc- tion due to pulmonary embolism.31 Other causes of right ventricular dilatation must also be considered, including RV infarction, pulmo- nary hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Bed- side echocardiography is not sufﬁciently sensitive (reported sensitivity of around 60-70%) for the detection of pulmonary embolism and thus, cannot exclude it as a diagnosis. 29,32 Patients with pulmonary embolism and evidence of right-heart dysfunction, however, have in- creased morbidity and mortality, and bedside echocardiography can be used to risk-stratify and to better manage these patients. 30, 33 44 MOVIE 2.38 - RV dilation and failure MOVIE 2.39 - RV dilation and failure due to PE - Clot in RA MOVIE 2.40 - RV dilation and fail- ure MOVIE 2.41 - RV pressure overload with flattening of septum SUMMARY Bedside echocardiography can be life-saving and dead sexy. It is essential to recognize one's limitations with cardiac ultra- sound. SECTION 6 Conclusion Bedside echocardiography provides clinicians with immediate struc- tural and physiologic data that can be life-saving. 5-6 The ability to as- sess patients for pericardial effusions, global left ventricular function, and right heart dilatation can provide answers to critical questions, risk-stratify patients, and further guide resuscitative efforts. It is essen- tial, however, to recognize one’s limitations when performing basic cardiac ultrasound and to obtain consultant-performed echocardi- ography when appropriate.

Ruptured AAA may present as un- differentiated hypotension and rapid diagnosis is essential. 50 FIGURE 3.1 Indications for AAA scan: Abdominal pain Back Pain Chest Pain Pulsatile Abdominal Mass Renal Colic Syncope Hypotension SECTION 2 Indications/Anatomy INDICATIONS The main impetus for the scan includes a clinical suspicion for AAA. Indications may include abdominal pain, back pain, chest pain, a pul- satile abdominal mass, “renal colic”, syncope, hypotension, weak- ness, or neurologic changes in the extremities. One high-risk group, in particular, includes older males with hypertension and a history of tobacco abuse. RELEVANT ANATOMY The abdominal aorta enters the abdomen through the diaphragm just inferior to the xiphoid process (T12) and bifurcates around the level of the umbilicus (L5). It has a predictable series of branches as pic- tured below. (Figure 3.2) 51 Aorta and its branches. FIGURE 3.2 The 1st branch off the abdominal aorta is the celiac trunk. (Movie 3.1) The celiac trunk divides into three vessels, although typically, only the hepatic artery and splenic artery are reliably visualized. The 2nd branch off the abdominal aorta is the superior mesenteric artery (SMA); typically, 1 cm caudal to the celiac trunk. The SMA runs par- allel to the abdominal aorta and can be tracked caudally with the abdominal aorta. While the renal arteries may be visualized, the branches of the gonadal and inferior mesenteric arteries are not typi- cally seen with ultrasound. The abdominal aorta ultimately bifur- cates into the common iliac vessels around the level of the umbilicus. 52 Celiac trunk of the proximal aorta MOVIE 3.1 Curvilinear probe is preferred probe Scan in transverse and longitudinal all the way through the bi- furcation of the iliacs Use steady pressure to scan through bowel gas Aneurysms can be fusiform (more common) or saccular SECTION 3 Technique PROBE SELECTION Curvilinear probe 2-5 MHz (preferable) or phased array probe 1-5 MHz. TECHNIQUE The general approach is to start with the probe indicator pointing to 9 o’clock, immediately caudal to the xiphoid process. This produces a transverse image of the abdominal aorta. You will need to scan from this mid-epigastric location caudally to the bifurcation of the aorta, visualizing the transverse high, mid, and low aorta. (Gallery 3.1, Movies 3.2 and 3.3) 53 Transverse high probe placement GALLERY 3.1 Technique Next, you will turn the probe towards the patient’s head at 12 o’clock. (Movie 3.4) 54 MOVIE 3.2 Normal scan of the transverse aorta MOVIE 3.3 Iliac bifurcation MOVIE 3.4 Normal scan of the proximal aorta in longitudinal IMAGE 3.1 - Longitudinal probe placement MOVIE 3.5 - Normal longitudinal scan of the aorta to the bifurcation This produces a longitudinal view of the aorta. Again, you will scan from the mid-epigastrium to the bifurcation at the umbilicus. (Image 3.1 and Movie 3.5) To adequately image the aorta, the ﬁrst step is to identify the verte- bral body. The vertebral body is horseshoe-shaped with an intense echogenic anterior surface and posterior shadowing. (Image 3.2) The aorta is anterior to the vertebral body and slightly to the pa- tient’s left (right side of the ultrasound im- age). The inferior vena cava (IVC) is also anterior to the vertebral body, and to the patient’s right. Scan caudally to the aortic bifurcation with methodical real-time visualization, without skipping any section of the aorta. As you scan cephalad to caudad (head to toe), identify the follow- ing: Celiac trunk, (Movie 3.1), SMA, and Aortic bifurication. (Gallery 3.2) 55 IMAGE 3.2 - Arrowheads indicating ver- tebral body on transverse view of the aorta Transverse aorta with celiac trunk (seagull sign); Hep A = hepatic art, Spl A = splenic art, * = aorta) GALLERY 3.2 Celiac Trunk, SMA, Aortic Bifurication Turn the probe to the longitu- d i n a l p l a n e (pointer to 12 o’clock) to ob- tain a longitu- dinal view of the aorta and the associated vessels (celiac an d SM A) . (Image 3.3) The s a me p r o x i m a l branches (ce- liac and SMA) seen in transverse plane should be seen in longitudinal plane. Again, move cephalad to caudad as you scan the entire length of the vessel. (Movie 3.6) IMPEDIMENTS & SOLUTIONS Ultrasound of the aorta can be quite difﬁcult depending on bowel gas and body habitus. Imaging impediments due to bowel gas usu- ally originate from the transverse colon, which sits in the epigastrium. If bowel is encountered, apply steady pressure (push down towards the patient’s back) with the probe. The bowel may be effectively compressed or undergo peristalsis. You may also try to jiggle the probe to move bowel aside. Another alternative is to fan through windows between loops of bowel. This is accomplished by establish- ing a good sonographic window, just cephalad to the area obscured by bowel, and tilting t he probe toward the feet. Similarly, ﬁnd a window just caudad to the ob- structed area and angle the probe up toward the head. Obesity impediments may be addressed by asking the patient to lie com- pletely ﬂat.

Finally, lower the scanning frequency to increase penetration. Normal US Findings: The normal aorta is < 3cm and tapers distally. Appropriate docu- mentation will include a caliper measurement of the proximal, mid and distal aorta. (Image 3.4) Measurements should be taken in the transverse plane, to limit the tangential effect of underestimating di- ameter on a longitudinal image of the aorta. ALWAYS MEASURE OUTER WALL TO OUTER WALL. A mural thrombus or plaque in the lumen may underestimate the size of the AAA. Abnormal US Findings: Any aortic measurement >3cm is abnormal; any aorta that fails to taper appropriately as it moves caudally is con- sidered abnormal as well. Of note, the majority of AAAs are INFRARENAL. 3 There are two types of aneurysm: fusiform and saccular. (Gallery 3.3) Fusiform aneurysms are much more common and involve dila- tion of the entire circumference of the affected segment of the aorta. (Gallery 3.3 and Movies 3.7-3.11) A saccular aneurysm is an asym- metric outpouching (i.e. sac-like) of the aorta. (Gallery 3.3 and Movie 3.12) 57 Arrows noting AP diameter of AAA GALLERY 3.4 GALLERY 3.3 58 MOVIE 3.7 - 3.5 cm AAA in transverse MOVIE 3.9 - 3.5 cm AAA in transverse to longitudinal MOVIE 3.11 - 6 cm AAA in transverse to longitudinal MOVIE 3.8 - 7 cm AAA in transverse to lon- gitudinal MOVIE 3.10 - 7 cm AAA in transverse MOVIE 3.12 - Saccular Aneurysm Of note, aneurysms may extend into the iliac arteries as well, so a comprehensive, methodical scan through the bifurcation is recom- mended. (Image 3.5 and Movie 3.13) Emergency bedside ultrasound is highly sensitive for the presence of an AAA but has poor sensitivity for acute rupture.4 Rupture of an AAA most commonly occurs into the retroperitoneal space and may tamponade before the patient becomes unstable. Unfortunately, ul- trasound does not reliably identify retroperitoneal blood. (Ultra- sound of retroperitoneal bleed) An AAA rupture occasionally is in- traperitoneal, with free ﬂuid readily identiﬁed by ultrasound. (Image 3.6 and Movie 3.14) This is a particularly ominous ﬁnding. An aor- tic dissection (ﬂoating intimal ﬂap) may occasionally be found while performing an US to rule out AAA.

Retroperitoneal rupture is hard to pick up on ultrasound Always measure in transverse completely perpendicular to the vessel Be careful to not mistake the IVC for the Aorta Dissection ﬂaps are easily overlooked SECTION 4 Pearls and Pitfalls Thrombus within an AAA can be mistaken for the aortic wall, leading to an underestimation of the true AAA diameter. To avoid this error, adjust the gain so that aortic lumen is black. If possible, decrease the dynamic range to improve the contrast between vessel wall and lumen. Be sure to measure outer wall to outer wall. Another pitfall is to assume an AAA is not ruptured in the absence of free intraperitoneal ﬂuid. Retroperitoneal bleeding, which is a far more common site of rupture, is NOT reliably detected by ultra- sound. (Case Study) Note: While ultrasound can reliably detect an AAA, it typically gives no information about rupture. Saccular aneurysms can be easily missed unless a thorough scan is performed. Systematic, continuous scanning in both longitudinal and transverse planes is essential to prevent a false negative diagnosis. An ectatic aorta may have irregular course. (Figure 3.3) 61 FIGURE 3.3 - Ectatic aorta Dynamic scanning, while adjusting for changes in vessel angle, will allow for complete visualization. Angled transverse cuts may exaggerate the true aortic diameter. Ob- tain measurements at 90° to the vessel. Off-axis (tangential) longitu- dinal cuts underestimate aortic diameter. Caliper measurements should be made in a transverse view only. Inexperienced sonographers can mistake the IVC for the aorta, espe- cially in long axis because both the aorta and IVC are pulsatile. (Im- age 3.7 and Movie 3.17) The aorta lies to the patient’s left of the IVC. Moreover, the aorta has anterior branches caudal to the liver, while the IVC does not. Finally, the aorta is typically more round, non-compressible, and has brighter, thicker walls than the IVC. Small aneurysms (< 4.5cm) can rupture, although less frequently than a larger AAA. If an AAA is identiﬁed by US, it still may not be the cause of the pa- tient’s symptoms. Consider abdominal, renal or musculoskeletal pa- thology. Dissection ﬂaps are easily overlooked. If there is a high clinical suspi- cion for AAA and the ultrasound is equivocal, obtain a CT (with con- trast if no renal impairment). 62 IMAGE 3.7 - Two panels comparing sono appearance of Aorta vs IVC MOVIE 3.17 - Comparison of aorta to IVC Tell everyone that you just ﬁnished another chapter!

For the last several decades the main- stay for initial diagnostic imaging has been the chest radiograph. However, there are some inherent failings with the chest radiograph. First, changes in the chest radiograph image lag behind a patient's clinical picture - sometimes as long as 24 hours behind. Second, while the technology is portable, it requires a technologist, a ma- chine that is usually not housed in the patient's room, image develop- ment that takes place in a remote area from the patient, and ﬁnal im- age interpretation by a consultant - all of which add complexity and time to the diagnostic imaging process. Finally, given that each chest radiograph involves some small but non-zero exposure to ionizing radiation, there is some risk to the patient, which increases as chest radiography is used to monitor a patient's condition over time and a response to treatment. Thoracic ultrasound has none of these limita- tions. The biggest challenges for thoracic ultrasound are to get the physician to think in a radically different way about how to visualize pathology and to empower the clinician to feel that the thoracic ultra- sound images are an equal, if not a more valid, indication of pathol- ogy and disease. 66 SUMMARY Pleural line is bright white line between rib shadows A-Lines represent normal lung B-Lines represent interstitial ﬂuid Low Frequency probe is preferred for most thoracic ultrasound (2.5-5 MHz Probe) SECTION 2 Basics/Terminology It is important to review a few anatomy points and terms before get- ting started with directed clinical questions for thoracic point-of-care ultrasound. First, anatomy and scan orientation. Rib shadows help to orient the sonographer by serving as a landmark for pleural line identiﬁcation. As the ribs approach the sternum, they become carti- laginous, and so sound can penetrate through the rib at this point. However, usually the ribs are calciﬁed and so cast a shadow as the sound cannot penetrate through bone (Movie 4.2). 67 Cartilaginous ribs where pleura can be seen deep to the an- terior rib surface MOVIE 4.1 Next, we can identify the pleural line. Because the visceral and parietal pleura are usually closely opposed, it appears as a bright white line (Movie 4.3). If there is an effusion, however, a dark stripe of ﬂuid separates the visceral from the parietal pleura (Movie 4.4). If you see this anteriorly, a large effusion or one that is located anteriorly is suspected. \t It is important to remember that a normal lung has well-aerated alveoli and very thin intersti- tial tissue holding the alveoli together. It is also important to remember that air does not transfer sound well, but instead scatters it so that the sound does not return to the probe in an organized fashion (Figure 4.1). 68 Calcified bony ribs that cast a shadow. MOVIE 4.2 Image of normal pleura - the pleural line must be deep to the rib shadow. MOVIE 4.3 Effusion separating visceral from parie- tal pleura. MOVIE 4.4 Drawing demonstrating the disorgan- ized scatter from air - low density air molecules reflect sound in a non- uniform pattern. FIGURE 4.1 In a well-aerated lung, once the sound goes deep to the pleural line reﬂection, it is scattered and no organized information is returned to the probe to generate an image. Instead, the bouncing back and forth between the skin surface and the pleural line creates a horizontal reverbera- tion artifact that is called an A-line (Movie 4.5). If there is ﬂuid or thickening of the interstitial tissue, however, the lung behaves more like a solid organ and sound is now able to reﬂect and refract such that a vertical, laser-like, bright, white line appears that originates from the pleura and is transmitted the full depth of the screen. These vertical lines are called B-lines and are a marker of interstitial thickening (from ﬂuid or ﬁbrosis) or alveolar ﬂuid (Movie 4.6). There are a few features of B-lines that should be highlighted to ensure that what is seen is truly a marker of interstitial ﬂuid. First, the B-line starts at the pleural line and travels at least to a depth of 18 cm (the minimum depth the screen should be set at when looking for this). In addition, B- lines will move back and forth with respiration as the pleural line moves. Finally, they initially appear as thin, single, vertical lines. As there is more interstitial ﬂuid, the lines can start to coalesce and become more wedge-shaped. There is a spectrum of B-lines ranging from none (when A-lines are usually seen), to mild, moderate, and severe, when there is often complete coalescence of single B-lines into white curtains of B-lines. (Gallery 4.1) 69 Horizontal A-line reverberations. MOVIE 4.5 Vertical B-line artifact. MOVIE 4.6 Lung sliding with rib shadows at either edge of the screen. MOVIE 4.7 For most thoracic sonography, using the low frequency probe is pre- ferred. The 2.5 - 5 MHz probe should be used when looking for in- terstitial disease and when looking for pleural effu- sions. When looking at the pleural line only, as when evaluating for pneumothorax, the linear probe with its higher resolution pictures can sometimes be helpful. It is also useful for orientation to start with the probe in a longitudinal position and orient with rib shadows at ei- ther edge of the screen (Movie 4.7). 70 Progression of B-line density GALLERY 4.1 Figures 2-5 SUMMARY Lung sliding rules out pneumothorax with nearly 100% sensitiv- ity in the area directly underneath the probe M-Mode may be helpful in identifying pneumothorax as a Bar- code Sign instead of the normal Seashore Sign. A lung point can be used to obtain an estimation of the size of a pneumothorax SECTION 3 Pneumothorax One of the simpler and more effective applications for thoracic ultra- sound is the evaluation for pneumothorax. The principle is simple. When the visceral and parietal pleura are opposed and respirations are observed, a slip-sliding or shimmering of the visceral on parietal pleura will be observed, essentially ruling out any air below the probe footprint with nearly 100% sensitivity.1,2 (Movie 4.8) Another indication that the visceral and parietal pleura are touching is that a reverberation artifact between these two closely opposed structures will create a vertical, bright line similar to the B-line described above, but also known in this particular case as a comet-tail (Movie 4.9). When viewed in m-mode, which portrays points along a line over time, the near ﬁeld, which is superﬁcial to the pleural line, is not mov- 71 Normal lung sliding MOVIE 4.8 ing and appears as straight lines. The far ﬁeld, deep to the pleural line, is shimmering back and forth and appears grainy. This is known as the seashore sign (Figure 4.6). When air is interposed between the visceral and parietal pleura, the visceral pleura separates from the parietal pleura. All sound distal to the parietal pleura is scattered and does not return to the ultra- sound probe in an organized fashion (Figure 4.1). Therefore, the pa- rietal pleura will be the last structure visualized by the ultrasound ma- chine and will appear as a ﬁxed, bright, white line (Movie 4.10). Deep to the pleural line, the high impedance of the air causes no real image to be generated. Instead, a reverberation artifact can cause mirroring, and sometimes a reﬂection of the chest wall can be seen. On m-mode, the chest wall still appears as straight lines, but since no lung sliding is seen, the area deep to the pleural line also appears as straight lines. This is known as the barcode sign (Figure 4.7). It is important to remember that lack of lung sliding can be seen in several conditions. Any condition that has ﬁxed the pleura with scar- ring can cause lack of lung sliding. Examples include pleurodesis, surgical scarring, pneumonia with adhesions, and others pathologic diseases. \t Care must be taken to clinically differentiate these from pneumothorax to minimize false positive interpretations. Occasion- ally, when the pleura are still opposed but are ﬁxed, comet-tail rever- 72 Comet tail with lung sliding. MOVIE 4.9 Figure 4.6 Seashore sign berations can still be seen with absent lung sliding and can help point to a false-positive for pneumothorax. When examining a su- pine patient, the probe should be placed over the anterior rib spaces, as air will tend to layer here. It stands to reason that the more complete the evaluation of the thoracic cavity, the more sensi- tive the lung ultrasound will be for ruling out pneumothorax. How- ever, studies have shown that the only pneumothoraces that would be missed if the anterior chest wall alone were scanned would be iso- lated apical pneumothoraces. 3 If there is a high degree of suspicion for a pneumothorax and the anterior chest wall shows lung sliding, scanning superiorly or even supraclavicularly to better evaluate the apices may be helpful.\tOne last ﬁnding, which is essentially pathog- nomonic for pneumothorax, is the lung point sign. This is seen when you scan the position where the visceral pleura reattaches to the chest wall. When the probe is held in this location, one half of the 73 Here only the fixed parietal pleura is seen. The visceral pleura is somewhere deep to the pocket of air. MOVIE 4.10 Figure 1.7 Barcode sign Figure 1.8 M-mode Lung point ultrasound screen will demonstrate lung sliding and one half of the screen will show a ﬁxed parietal pleura (Movie 4.11). On m-mode, you will see alternating seashore and barcode signs, which vary with respirations (Figure 4.8). The lung point can be found by moving the probe around the chest wall, from areas of lung sliding to areas with- out lung sliding, until both are seen in the same location, as the pa- tient breathes (Movie 4.12). This point of reattachment can be fol- lowed around the chest wall to demonstrate an estimation of the size of the pneumothorax. Video demonstrating the lung point MOVIE 4.11 This video (courtesy of Dr. Fernando Silva) shows how you can use the lung point to estimate the extent of a pneu- mothorax. MOVIE 4.12 74 SUMMARY Ultrasound may be superior to chest radiography for detection of pleural effusion. The mirror image sign indicates that there is not a pleural effu- sion present.  The spine sign indicates that there is a pleural effu- sion present. Pericardial effusions and pleural effusions can be differentiated based on position of ﬂuid. SECTION 4 Pleural Effusion Another very simple and very effective application of thoracic sonography is the evaluation for pleural effusion. Again, research has shown not only is lung ultrasound comparable to chest radiogra- phy, it may be superior. In addition to its diagnostic value, thoracic ultrasound is able to assist in procedural guidance as well. 4-6 This application takes advantage, again, of the ability of the well- aerated lung to scatter sound. When looking in the anterior or poste- rior axillary line in the longitudinal plane with a low frequency probe, the diaphragm should be identiﬁed. The diaphragm will be a 75 Figure 4.9 Normal aerated lung with diaphragm highlighted. bright, white structure that pulls inferiorly with inspiration in a sponta- neously breathing patient (Figure 4.9). If there is air above the diaphragm, as in a normal lung, the sound wave will reﬂect off of the diaphragm and then be reﬂected back to the diaphragm after traveling through the liver or spleen tissue (Movie 4.13). In this case, the ultrasound machine will assume the sound wave trav- eled in a straight line, and so liver tissue reﬂections will appear both above and below the diaphragm. This phenomenon is called the mir- ror image, and indicates that there is no pleural effusion and that the lung is well aerated. The lack of a mirror image artifact indicates that there is ﬂuid above the lung, since sound can travel through the ﬂuid and the effusion can be visualized directly (Movie 4.14). Sometimes, however, the mirror image can be tricky to identify. In this case, we have another way to identify pleural ﬂuid, which is known as the spine sign. This, again, makes use of sound’s ability to travel through ﬂuid instead of being scattered by air. The spinous processes and vertebral bodies are deep to the kidney and spleen/ liver when looking from the mid-axillary probe position. If the tho- racic cavity is full of air, as the diaphragm expands and pulls cau- dally to aerate the lung, the shadow from the lung will cover the 76 Animation demonstrating the reverberation and reflection that takes place with a normal lung and the diaphragm. MOVIE 4.13 Video demonstrating an above the diaphragm-mid-axillary view. MOVIE 4.14 spine shadows above the diaphragm (Movie 4.15). When the tho- racic cavity is full of ﬂuid, sound can travel through the thoracic cav- ity to the thoracic spine, and so the spine shadows are seen through- out respiration (Movie 4.16). Pleural effusions can also be visualized in other locations. Left-sided effusions can be seen in the far ﬁeld of a parasternal long axis car- diac image and taper to the descending thoracic aorta where peri- cardial effusions would cross anterior to the aorta (Movie 4.17). Right-sided effusions can be seen deep to the diaphragm in a subxi- phoid cardiac view (Movie 4.18). And as mentioned earlier, large effusions can sometimes be seen when scanning the anterior chest wall (Movie 4.19). 77 Video demonstrating the diaphragm pulling over the spine reflection and obscuring it indicating the thoracic cavity is full of air.

MOVIE 4.19 SUMMARY Pulmonary ultrasound has been shown to be superior to chest radiography in identifying interstitial disease in the right clinical scenario. Ultrasound can be used to identify pulmonary edema, pulmo- nary ﬁbrosis, and infection. SECTION 5 Interstitial Disease The ability of thoracic ultrasound to distinguish between aerated lung and lung with interstitial ﬂuid or disease has been well documented. 7-9 Clinical correlation is imperative as interstitial thicken- ing can be a process of pulmonary edema, pulmonary ﬁbrosis, infec- tion or tumor/scarring. In the right clinical scenario, however, pulmo- nary ultrasound has been shown to be superior to chest radiography in identifying interstitial disease.10 The scanning technique uses the low frequency probe to scan in eight zones of the thoracic cavity to get a good sense of the distribution of disease (Figure 4.10). 79 Figure demonstrating the eight scanning zones as described by Dr. Giovanni Volpicelli. Figure 4.10 An isolated B-line - especially in the lateral and inferior lung zones - is considered normal or non-pathologic, but more than three B-lines per zone is considered pathologic, and that zone is considered posi- tive for interstitial disease. The more B-lines that are present, the more pathologic the interstitial process, and this holds true across the disease spectrum including pulmonary edema, pulmonary ﬁbrosis, and infection. 8,9,11(Movie 4.20) There are a few clues that the clinician sonographer can use to help distinguish between the different etiologies of interstitial disease. In general, congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema are caused by ﬂuid translocation, and so the pleural line in pulmonary edema will remain thin and regular (Movie 4.21). In contrast, diffuse infec- tion or inﬂammation causing interstitial disease will tend to affect the pleura as well. In ﬁbrosis, pneumonia, tuberculosis or other diffuse pulmonary infectious processes, the pleural line becomes irregular, lumpy and has areas of subpleural ﬂuid collections 12,13 (Movie 4.22). 80 Video showing diffuse B-lines. This patient had flash pul- monary edema requiring non-invasive ventilation and after- load reduction. MOVIE 4.20 - B-Lines Video showing B-lines and thin pleural line. MOVIE 4.21 - B-Lines There is also some interesting evidence demonstrating prognostic value to the number and coalescence of B-lines on the initial evalua- tion for patients with dyspnea. Patients with high initial B-line scores had a worse prognosis and higher event scores at 16 months than pa- tients with low B-line scores. B-line scores outperformed other echo- cardiographic variables as a univariate predictor. 14. 81 Video showing B-lines and lumpy bumpy pleural line. MOVIE 4.22 SUMMARY Lung Sonography is a distinct improvement over chest radiogra- phy in the evaluation of pneumonia. Lung ultrasound can distinguish between lung consolidation and atelectasis SECTION 6 Consolidation/Pneumonia In infection, as the interstitial space starts to consolidate and the alve- oli and air-ﬁlled space in the lung become ﬁlled with ﬂuid or purulent material, sound is transmitted through this tissue in the same way as through other soft tissue density organs in the body, such as the liver. The lung now behaves more as a solid organ and takes the appear- ance of a liver. This phenomenon is called hepatization, and it is easy to see why (Movie 4.23). This ﬁnding has been well correlated with areas of consolidation on chest radiographs and with chest computed tomography. Indeed, multiple studies have shown that lung sonography is as sensitive and speciﬁc as computed tomography for pneumonia, and it is a distinct 82 Video showing consolidation. MOVIE 4.23 improvement over chest radiography.15-17 In fact, the spectrum of in- fectious pulmonary disease reliably progresses from focal areas of interstitial disease (i.e. more than three B-lines per rib space in a fo- cal pattern) to areas of coalescence of B-lines and irregular pleural lines to consolidation. This spectrum appears to follow the progres- sion of disease seen on other gold standard diagnostic imaging, such as computed tomography. 10,15-19 One interesting advantage of lung sonography is that it appears it can distinguish between lung consolidation and atelectasis, which is oftentimes a challenge for chest radiography. For consolidative proc- esses, such as pneumonia or other infectious processes, the bronchi will be generally unobstructed, and because of the distinct difference in tissue density, the air moving in the bronchi with respiration will ap- pear to be a bright, shimmery column, described as mobile air bron- chograms (Movie 4.24). In contrast, atelectasis is a result of bron- chial plugging, and so the air column within the consolidation is not mobile and is described as static (Movie 4.25). 83 Video showing dynamic air bronchograms MOVIE 4.24 Video showing static air bronchograms. MOVIE 4.25 SUMMARY Fluid overload resolution can be observed in real-time with ultra- sound Lung sonography can replace chest radiography in both emer- gency and critical care patients! SECTION 7 Monitoring Pulmonary Function One of the strengths of pulmonary ultrasound over other forms of pul- monary diagnostic imaging is that the changes appear to resolve in real-time.20-22 As observed in patients undergoing dialysis, the B- lines of ﬂuid overload appear to resolve in hours.21 As observed in patients undergoing increases or decreases in the positive end- expiratory pressure settings on ventilators, the consolidation and B- lines appear or disappear rapidly. 22 (Figure 4.11) This real-time monitoring function has the added advantage of being performed with a modality that requires no ionizing radiation, no patient trans- port and no lag time between image acquisition and interpretation for a trained clinician sonographer. This has led to a series of recent articles looking at whether or not lung sonography could, in fact, re- place chest radiography for both emergency and critical care patients. 10,18,19 In our view, the answer is a resounding yes! 84 IMAGE 4.1 Tell everyone that you just ﬁnished another chapter!

Historically, there has been far less urgency to use ultrasound to evaluate the medical patient with hypotension or signs of shock. The main reasons for this discrepancy are the lack of a uni- versally accepted name for the exam and a standardized sequence of views to obtain. The Rapid Ultrasound for Shock and Hypotension exam (RUSH), ﬁrst described in 2007, solved this problem with an easy to remember moniker (RUSH) and an acronym (HI-MAP) that serves as a cognitive prompt of the views required. In 2001, Rose et al. published an ultrasound protocol they had cre- ated to evaluate the undifferentiated hypotensive patient.1 A few years later, Jones et al. studied the effects of early goal-directed ul- trasound for ED patients with hypotension.2 This study showed a re- duction in the number of conditions that needed to be ruled out, as well as a quicker time to ﬁnal diagnosis. Recently, additional articles have discussed the use of focused ultrasound for cardiac arrest and shock patients without obvious etiology.3-4 In an effort to aggregate all of the various diagnostic ultrasound tech- niques applicable to these patients into a memorable approach, We- ingart et al. created the RUSH exam.5 RUSH was designed to be rapid and easy to perform with portable machines found in most emergency departments. The components of the exam are views of the: heart, inferior vena cava (IVC), abdomen and thorax as for the extended FAST exam, and of the aorta. These components can be recalled with the mnemonic HI-MAP, which prompts the clinician to scan in sequence the Heart, IVC, Morison’s (the FAST exam), Aorta 89 and Pneumothorax. We will discuss each of the components in detail below. 90 SUMMARY Evaluate for: Pericardial effusion and tamponade Right Ventricular Failure Pulmonary Embolism SECTION 2 Heart The heart portion of the RUSH exam evaluates for pericardial effu- sion and tamponade, right ventricular failure as a sign of pulmonary embolism and a qualitative assessment of left ventricular function. Of the views described in the Basic Cardiac chapter, the ones used for the RUSH exam are the parasternal long axis and the four-chamber view (see Movie 5.1 and 5.2). 91 MOVIE 5.1 - Parasternal long axis. MOVIE 5.2 - Apical four-chamber. PERICARDIAL TAMPONADE The parasternal long axis view and apical four chamber view are used to assess for pericardial ﬂuid, which is best identiﬁed posterior to the left ventricle (LV) and anterior to the descending aorta (see Movie 5.3 and 5.4). In the setting of shock and hypotension, more than trace pericardial ﬂuid should increase your suspicion for pericar- dial tamponade. However, an experienced ultrasonographer can as- sess for this condition directly. In the same parasternal long view, if there is collapse of the right atrium during diastole (sensitive) and the right ventricle (RV) during early diastole (speciﬁc), then the diagnosis is likely to be tamponade (see Movie 5.5). 6 If tamponade is diagnosed, ultrasound can be used dynamically to aid in t h e pe r f o r man ce o f pe r icardio ce n t e sis (L i n k t o pericardiocentesis/Procedures chapter). Ideally, a large pocket of ﬂuid with a good amount of space between the pericardium and the heart, without interposed lung, will be identi- ﬁed. This site may be sub-xiphoid, but more often it is on the anterior chest wall. Ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis is safer than a blind sub-xiphoid procedure. 7 RIGHT VENTRICULAR ENLARGEMENT Rarely, actual pulmonary artery clot can be visualized during transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), but massive pulmonary embo- lism is more likely to present with only indirect signs. Signs of acute right ventricular failure (RVF) will often accompany pulmonary embo- lism signiﬁcant enough to cause shock. An enlarged right ventricle on the four-chamber view (Movie 5.6) points to RVF as one of the con- tributors to the patient’s shock state. RVF can be caused by many en- tities, but when it is acute in the setting of shock, the most likely diag- noses are massive pulmonary embolism and right ventricular infarc- tion. 92 MOVIE 5.5 - Pericardial tamponade MOVIE 5.3 - Pericardial effusion MOVIE 5.4 - Pericardial tamponade The right ventricle is normally less than 60 percent of the size of the left ventricle. When the RV size is equal to or larger than the LV, RV strain should be suspected. Another sign of RV strain can be ﬂatten- ing or bowing of the interventricular septal wall that can be seen on the apical four-chamber view (see Movie 5.7). Increased right-sided pressure will also be seen well on the parasternal short axis view, causing a “D” shaped left ventricle (see Movie 5.8). 8 Enlargement of the right ventricle can also occur from right ventricu- lar infarction. This diagnosis will often present with signs of inferior wall infarction on electrocardiogram and may have associated left ventricular dysfunction. However, cardiogenic shock can occur from isolated right ventricular failure without associated EKG or left ven- tricular abnormalities. 9 HYPODYNAMIC LEFT VENTRICLE In the setting of hypotension, the qualitative assessment of LV func- tion can indicate a cardiogenic cause. Depressed LV function can be the result of a primary problem, e.g. infarction or myopathy, or it can be secondary to conditions such as sepsis or toxins. While more complicated procedures allow a numeric estimate of the ejection frac- tion, in the setting of hypotension, a visual estimate often sufﬁces. 10 In parasternal long view, at the level of the papillary muscles, a change in LV chamber size from systole to diastole that is less than 30 percent indicates a severely decreased LV function (see Movie 5.9). 93 MOVIE 5.6 - Right ventricular failure/ enlargement MOVIE 5.7 - RV strain MOVIE 5.8 - RV pressure and volume over- load with septal flattening((end diastolic size-end systolic size)/end diastolic size) In 2002, Moore et al. found that a group of physicians that had wit- nessed a reasonable number of normal and abnormal exams during a brief training could estimate LV function after a few seconds of see- ing the heart’s function. 11 HYPERDYNAMIC LEFT VENTRICLE In the same echocardiographic view just mentioned, if the left ven- tricular walls change by more than 90 percent between systole and diastole, or if they actually touch at end systole, then the LV is hy- perdynamic (see Movie 5.10). This can be seen in hypovolemia, acute blood loss, and often in sepsis prior to the administration of va- sopressors. These patients will usually beneﬁt from volume loading. 94 MOVIE 5.9 - Severely decreased LV function MOVIE 5.10 - Hyperdynamic LV SUMMARY Dynamic changes in IVC can estimate volume status IVC collapses with inspiration in spontaneously breathing pa- tients IVC collapses with expiration in mechanically ventilated patients Greater than an 18% change in IVC size in mechanically venti- lated patients predicts an increase in cardiac output to a ﬂuid challenge. SECTION 3 Inferior Vena Cava The evaluation of the IVC (link to ﬂuid responsiveness) can give an estimate of the volume status of the patient. The exam outlined below is a dynamic evaluation of ﬁlling pressures based on respiration. The exam is conducted differently depending on whether the patient is spontaneously breathing or if the patient is on mechanical ventila- tion. SPONTANEOUSLY BREATHING PATIENTS The IVC should ﬁrst be located in longitudinal orientation in the sub- xiphoid area. This view is most easily obtained by ﬁrst obtaining a subxiphoid four-chamber view of the heart and then, with the right atrium centered on the screen, rotating the probe 90 degrees on its axis. Collapsibility of the IVC should be evaluated 2 centimeters be- low the junction between IVC and right atrium (see Movie 5.11). 95 MOVIE 5.11 - IVC Both the diameter of the IVC and the response to inspiratory effort are examined. The latter is often best assessed using M-mode ultra- sonography (Image 5.1). The IVC portion of the exam allows an estimation of the central ve- nous pressure (CVP) and predicts a beneﬁcial response to ﬂuid bolus. An IVC diameter of <1.5 cm with complete inspiratory collapse is as- sociated with a response to volume loading, and these ﬁndings are associated with a low CVP (<5) (see Movie 5.12). 12 Conversely, an IVC diameter of >2.5 cm with no inspiratory collapse represents a high CVP (>20) and the patient is unlikely to increase their cardiac output in response to ﬂuid loading. 12 If the patient is in- travascularly depleted in this setting, they will need agents to in- crease their inotropy or decrease their afterload before ﬂuids will be helpful. MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS In contrast to spontaneously breathing patients, mechanical inspira- tion causes the IVC to enlarge. The difference between the inspira- tory and expiratory size of the IVC can be used to gauge the need for ﬂuid loading. In order to accurately assess the IVC in ventilated patients, they must be sedated enough to not be taking spontaneous breaths during the time of measurement. In addition, the ventilator 96 IMAGE 5.1 - IVC M-Mode Measurement MOVIE 5.12 - Low CVPshould be adjusted to deliver 10 ml/kg of tidal volume. Even in pa- tients with acute lung injury, placing a patient on this tidal volume for the ~20 seconds of measurement will cause no ill effects. The patient should be returned to their previous ventilator settings after assessing the IVC. Many studies have evaluated IVC diameter changes as a measure- ment of response to ﬂuid loading. 13 Unfortunately, these studies cal- culated their cut-off points using different formulae. The simpler for- mula is Barbier’s. 13 ((Insp size – Exp Size)/Exp size) The result is expressed as a percentage; using this formula the cut-off is 18 percent change. Values greater than this predict an increase in cardiac output to a ﬂuid challenge. 97 SUMMARY FAST exam can identify causes of hypotension such as: Ectopic pregnancy Massive ascites Ruptured viscus Spontaneous intraabdominal bleed Traumatic intraabominal bleed Intraperitoneal rupture of AAA SECTION 4 FAST Exam MORISON’S AND THE FAST EXAM The FAST exam (link to FAST) is perhaps the most well recognized use of point of care ultrasound. Imaging for free ﬂuid in the right up- per quadrant, left upper quadrant, and suprapubic area can provide a clue to many etiologies of hypotension, such as ectopic pregnancy, massive ascites, ruptured viscus, spontaneous intraabdominal bleed- ing, intraperitoneal rupture of an AAA, etc. (see Movies 5.13-5.20). If there is not time to complete all of these views, an image of Mori- son’s pouch with the patient in Trendelenburg position is sensitive for signiﬁcant intraperitoneal blood or ﬂuid. 14 When performing the upper quadrant views, sliding the probe up to the thorax allows us to image the interface between lung and dia- phragm for hypoechoic ﬂuid or blood in either hemithorax. 15 98 RUQ Normal MOVIE 5.13 99 LUQ Normal MOVIE 5.15 Pelvic Transverse Normal MOVIE 5.17 Pelvic Sagittal Normal MOVIE 5.18 FAST Positive RUQ MOVIE 5.14 FAST Positive LUQ MOVIE 5.16 100 FAST Positive Right Hemithorax MOVIE 5.19 FAST Positive Pelvic MOVIE 5.20 SUMMARY If aorta >5cm, then a patient in shock has a ruptured AAA until proven otherwise Scan at 4 levels: Subxiphoid Suprarenal Infrarenal Just before iliac bifurcation SECTION 5 Aorta Scanning the abdominal aorta (link to aorta) for aneurysm (AAA) is one of the key emergency ultrasound modalities. We prefer to scan the aorta in transverse orientation at four levels: just below the heart, suprarenal, infrarenal, and just before the iliac bifurcation. 16 By slid- ing the probe down from the xiphoid to the umbilicus, these four views can be obtained in a continuous and rapid fashion (see Movie 5.21). If the Aorta is >5 cm in any of these views and the patient is in shock, the diagnosis is a ruptured AAA until proven otherwise (see Movie 5.22). 101 MOVIE 5.21 - Normal aorta scan in transverse 102 MOVIE 5.22 - Massive Aortic Aneurysm SUMMARY Scan from the midclavicular second intercostal space to the last rib Normal lung will have a shimmering pleural line Pneumothorax will have a pleural line with loss of shimmering Causes of false positive for pneumothorax: Mainstem bronchus intubation Bronchial obstruction SECTION 6 Pneumothorax Though far more likely in trauma, tension pneumothorax can be a cause of shock in medical patients as well, especially if the patient has recently had a procedure such as a central line, pacemaker placement, lung biopsy, or thoracentesis. Scan the anterior chest wall of both thoraces with probe held in a parasagittal orientation from the midclavicular second intercostal space to the last rib with a high frequency linear, microconvex or phased array probe. Nor- mally apposed pleural surfaces will appear to slide against one an- other resulting in a shimmering effect. This is normal lung sliding (see Movie 5.23). 103 MOVIE 5.23 - Normal lung sliding In pneumothorax, the pleura are no longer apposed and this sliding will disappear (Movie 5.24). Pathognomonic for pneumothorax is the transition from normally apposed pleura to pleura separated by the air of a pneumothorax. When this lung point is found, you will see normal pleural sliding on one side of your screen with loss of slid- ing on the other (see Movie 5.25). We have found imaging in M-mode to make for the easiest interpreta- tion. The seashore sign (see image 5.2), with static lines above and the granular pattern of normal lung movement below the pleura, re- assures that there is no pneumothorax at the location of the probe. If the stratosphere sign (image 5.3), with static lines above and below the pleura, is observed, then pneumothorax is likely. 18 One caution in intubated patients: abnormal lung sliding can be seen due to decreased lung aeration on the contralateral side with main- stem bronchus intubation and on the ipsilateral side with bronchial obstruction. In these cases, identiﬁcation of lung pulse (see Movie 5.26 and image 5.4), which represents cardiac activity transmitted to normally apposed pleura, indicates that mainstem intubation or bron- chial obstruction has resulted in abnormal pleural sliding rather than pneumothorax.18 104 MOVIE 5.24 - Pneumothorax - Loss of lung sliding or shim- mering MOVIE 5.25 - Lung point 105 IMAGE 5.2 - Seashore sign - Normal lung IMAGE 5.3 - Stratosphere or barcode sign - Pneu- mothorax MOVIE 5.26 - Lung Pulse IMAGE 5.4 - Lung Pulse with M-mode SUMMARY The entire exam can be done in 2 minutes Remember HI-MAP acronym SECTION 7 Sequencing and Conclusion This entire exam can be completed in less than 2 minutes using read- ily available portable machines. The HI-MAP acronym serves as a mnemonic prompt to remind us of the sequence of views (see image 5.5). 1. Heart: Obtain parasternal long view and then apical four cham- ber cardiac view using a phased array cardiac probe or microcon- vex probe. 106 IMAGE 5.5 2. IVC: switch to a large curvilinear general-purpose probe to obtain dynamic views of the IVC. 3. Morison’s (and FAST): Obtain Morison’s and splenorenal views imaging both hemithoraces, and then scan the bladder (transverse and sagittal). 4. Aorta: Increase your depth to ﬁnd the aorta at the epigastrium; in one motion, scan through entire aorta to bifurcation. 5. Pneumothorax: Scan both sides of the chest for pneumothorax. If unable to image the pleural interface appropriately with large cur- vilinear probe, switch to a high frequency linear transducer. CONCLUSION The RUSH exam provides a sequenced approach to ultrasound in the critically ill shocked or hypotensive patient. Using the HI-MAP compo- nents, we can evaluate for the causes of hypotension and tissue malp- erfusion and respond appropriately. The name of the exam, RUSH, ought to inspire the same alacrity to perform ultrasound in the sick medical patient as the ubiquitous FAST has in trauma. Tell everyone that you ﬁnished another chapter!

Gallstones are bright intraluminal structures that cast dark shad- ows The normal GB wall thickness is <3mm The normal intraluminal CBD diameter is <7mm A positive sonographic Murphy’s sign is the most sensitive ultra- sonographic ﬁnding of acute cholecystitis. SECTION 1 Introduction The primary tools used in the evaluation of the patient with right up- per quadrant (RUQ) pain and suspected hepatobiliary disease are ultrasound, HIDA scanning, computed tomography, ERCP, and MRCP. The primary objectives of the clinical evaluation are to rule out gallstones and differentiate between biliary colic and more seri- ous etiologies, such as acute cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis. Clinical indications for performing bedside RUQ ultrasound include physical exam ﬁndings, including RUQ pain, fever, nausea, vomiting and jaundice. RUQ ultrasound can be utilized when the physician has clinical suspicion for cholelithiasis, biliary colic, acute cholecysti- tis, or biliary duct obstruction. Data from numerous studies show that the sensitivity of RUQ US for the diagnosis of cholecystitis in the hands of the experienced sonographer can be as high as 90-97% with a speciﬁcity of 95%. 1,2 Other studies have shown that the sensi- tivity of CT scanning may be as low as 94%.1,3,4 It is clear from the literature that the use of bedside ultrasonography in the hands of an experienced user is the most accurate, speedy and cost efﬁcient way to evaluate RUQ pain. 4-8 111 SUMMARY The right upper quadrant of the abdomen contains a variety of solid and hollow organs. (Image 6.1) The largest and most predominant is the liver. The liver is bor- dered superiorly by the diaphragm and inferiorly by the gall- bladder (GB), superior pole of the right kidney and duodenum. SECTION 2 Anatomy 112 IMAGE 6.1 SUMMARY The liver is the acoustic window Moving the patient into the left lateral decubitus position can improve the ability to visualize the gallbladder Have the patient take a deep breath to improve visualization The curvilinear probe is preferred SECTION 3 Patient & Probe Positioning The RUQ scan is performed by placing the probe just inferior to the costal margin, just to the right of midline, with the probe marker ori- ented to the patient’s head or to the right. 113 MOVIE 6.1 - How to perform the RUQ ultrasound One Minute Ultrasound Gallbladder Ultrasound Demo The liver is utilized as the acoustic window for this view and should appear at the top of the screen. Once identiﬁed, the GB should be visualized completely in 2 planes, sagittal and axial. (Gallery 6.1) The gallbladder may lie beneath the lower right ribs, obscuring its view. In this case, the patient may be asked to take and hold a deep breath in order to move the gallbladder inferiorly. Alternatively, the patient may be placed in the left lateral decubitus position. (Gallery 6.1) By placing the patient into this position, the liver will shift due to gravity and effectively move the GB out from underneath the acous- tic interference of the ribs. If you continue to have difﬁculty visualiz- ing the GB, having the patient take and hold a deep breath will of- ten help as well. While most people choose to use the curvilinear transducer, the phased array probe may also be used if a curvilinear transducer is not available (Gallery 6.2). The main advantage of using the curvi- linear probe is the ability to accurately visualize deeper structures within the abdomen. The larger footprint of the curvilinear transducer also allows the operator to push harder on the patient’s abdomen to disperse bowel gas. This level of pressure would be uncomfortable with the phased array probe. The curvilinear probe’s footprint is, however, a disadvantage as well because the large footprint can cause more rib shadowing. When evaluating the RUQ and GB, the depth should be adjusted so that important structures ﬁll approxi- mately two thirds of the screen. 114 The liver is utilized as the acoustic window for this view and should appear at the top of the screen.

VISUALIZE THE GB IN TWO PLANES. (See Gallery 6.2). The normal gallbladder is 7-8 cm in length and 2-3 cm in width. It is usually ﬂuid ﬁlled. (Movies 6.2,6.3,6.4, and 6.5). 115 MOVIE 6.2 - Gallbladder long axis MOVIE 6.3 - Power doppler showing portal vein a. Assess for presence or absence of gallstone. (Image 6.2) i.

Assess for presence or absence of pericholecys- tic ﬂuid. (Image 6.3) 116 MOVIE 6.4 - Gallbladder long axis MOVIE 6.5 - Gallbladder short axis IMAGE 6.2 IMAGE 6.3 Caution should be taken in order to not mistake ascitic ﬂuid for peri- cholecystic ﬂuid. Although hard to differentiate, if you are able to identify ﬂuid throughout the peritoneum, it likely represents ascites. 2. FAN THROUGH THE GB FROM THE FUNDUS TO THE NECK. \t (See Movie 6.2) 3. MEASURE THE ANTERIOR GB WALL. \t a. Greater than 3mm is considered abnormal. 1 (Gallery 6.3) 4. MEASURE THE CBD AS MEDIALLY AS POSSIBLE. \t a. Measurement of the CBD is made from inner wall to inner \t \t \t wall, an intraluminal diameter. Normal is < 7 mm. (Gal-\t \t \t lery 6.4). A CBD diameter > 1cm is highly consistent \t \t \t with bile duct obstruction. A general rule of thumb is that \t \t the CBD should be less than the ﬁrst number of the pa-\t \t \t tient’s age. Thus, a 50 year old should have a CBD < \t \t \t 5mm, while a 90 year old should have a CBD < 9mm. \t \t \t When ﬁnding the CBD, color or power imaging should be \t \t used to ensure you are measuring the CBD and not the \t \t \t hepatic artery. 117 Normal gallbladder wall GALLERY 6.3 Normal is <7mm GALLERY 6.4 Whenever in doubt about the ﬁnding seen on US, a second image should be captured from a different probe position to develop a three dimensional picture in the sonographer’s mind. 9,10 Evaluation of the common bile duct can be frustrating for beginner sonographers. Identiﬁcation of the portal triad will help with identiﬁ- cation of the CBD. The portal triad is composed of the main portal vein, hepatic artery and the CBD. When viewing the GB longitudinally, the neck of the GB should point to the portal triad (Image 6.4). This is commonly referred to as the Mickey Mouse sign. Color or power Doppler may be used at this point in time to help identify the portal vein and hepatic artery. (Movie 6.6 and Image 6.5) With the indicator pointed to the patient’s right, Mickey’s right ear will be the common bile duct and the left ear will be the hepatic ar- tery. (Gallery 6.5) 118 IMAGE 6.4 - Portal triad MOVIE 6.6 - Portal triad with color flow IMAGE 6.5 - Portal triad with CBD measurement Use of color flow to identify hepatic artery. GALLERY 6.5 SUMMARY Gallstones are echogenic with posterior shadowing Gallstones are gravitationally dependent SECTION 5 Gallstones Gallstones will typically appear as echogenic material with acoustic shadowing beneath the gallstones (Images 6.6 and 6.7, Movie 6.7). 119 IMAGE 6.6 IMAGE 6.7 - Wall Echo Sign (WES) MOVIE 6.7 - Large gallstone filling GB They will vary in size and may be as large as the gallbladder lumen or so small they are barely identiﬁable. Shadowing occurs due to the absence of ultrasonic wave transmission through the acoustically stiff stones. In addition to shadowing, gallstones should be found in the most dependent portion of the GB, as they are gravitationally de- pendent. Shadowing intraluminal structures that do not appear to be gravitationally dependent should heighten the operator’s suspicion for GB polyps. 120 SUMMARY Cholecystitis is a clinical diagnosis Ultrasound ﬁnding suggestive of cholecystitis include: Increased GB wall thickening Pericholecystic ﬂuid Sonographic Murphy's signs (most sensitive) SECTION 6 Cholecystitis Cholecystitis is diagnosed by the presence of gallstones and the following: 1 1. GB WALL THICKNESS GREATER THAN 3 MM 2. PERICHOLECYSTIC FLUID 3. PRESENCE OF A SONOGRAPHIC MURPHY’S SIGN 121 IMAGE 6.8 - Gallstone with borderline increased wall thickness It is important to remember that gallbladder wall thickening can be found in a variety of clinical settings, including GB contraction from a recent meal, pancreatitis, ascites, and alcoholic hepatitis; there- fore, it cannot be considered pathognomonic. However, each addi- tional ﬁnding incrementally increases the diagnostic cer tainty.3,11,12 Occasion- ally, the sonographer may observe what is known as t he wall ec ho shadow (WES) sign. This typically occurs in a gallbladder that is ﬁlled with gallstones but has contracted, thereby emptying its bile. It will be seen as an echogenic line appearing near the anterior wall of the GB and poste- rior acoustic shadow. This is a tricky diagnosis and often missed by novice ultra- sonographers. The operator should have a heighten sus- picion for WES when there is clinical concern for bili- ary colic but no GB is identi- ﬁable on ultrasound. The WES is most often mistaken for bowel wall, and with good reason.

Occasionally the gallstone(s) will become impacted in the ampulla of Vater just before entry into the small intestines, which can cause pancreatitis. Patients with uncompli- cated disease may present with normal laboratory tests. However, if the ﬂow of bile is impeded due to this blockage, it can cause abdomi- nal pain, elevated liver enzymes, jaundice or pancreatitis. Further- more, the stagnant bile can become infected and cause ascending cholangitis, a life threatening condition. The initial imaging study of choice is again transabdominal ultra- sound. The sensitivity of US for CBD stones can be as high as 90%. 5,9,13 Despite this high accuracy, in cases of high pretest prob- ability and a negative bedside ultrasound, a more deﬁnitive test should be performed, such as a complete ultrasound or MRCP. The common bile duct should measure less than 7 mm in diameter in normal individuals. Typical ultrasound ﬁndings of choledocholithiasis are a dilated CBD and a dilated gallbladder, often with gallstones in it. Although rare, it is possible to see impacted gallstones in the bile duct. The sensitivity of detecting bile duct stones has been reported as high as 80% . 14 However, the majority of gallstones will lodge at the distal end of the common bile duct, an area which is often ob- scured by overlying bowel gas. A dilated CBD >7mm (>10mm if the patient has had a cholecystectomy) should raise concern for choledo- cholithiasis in the correct clinical setting. 123 In summary, bedside ultrasound may be utilized to aid in diagnosis of a variety of diseases in patients presenting with RUQ abdominal pain. However, this exam is one of the most challenging even for ad- vanced sonographers. Thus, a normal exam should not outweigh a high clinical suspicion. Tell everyone you ﬁnished another chapter!

In recent years, CT has replaced the physical exam and plain X-ray in the evaluation of these patients. However, ultrasound has many advantages over CT scanning including shorter length of stay, lower cost, and improved safety proﬁles. 1,2 Rosen and colleagues demonstrated a 147-minute reduction in length of stay when performing ultrasound in the place of CT for the evaluation of renal colic.1 Furthermore, recent literature on CT utilization has increased physician awareness of the ill effects associated with ionizing radiation exposure from CT scans.3,4,5 For these reasons, there is growing interest in the use of US instead of CT for the evaluation of ﬂank pain and suspected nephrolithiasis. Renal US is becoming more commonly used and is considered a safe initial test in the evaluation of suspected nephrolithiasis and renal colic. In practice, US is commonly applied when the clinical suspicion for a kidney stone is high and the concern for another etiology of ﬂank pain, such as an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), is low. Al- though stones in the kidney are easily visualized on US, when they pass into the ureter and cause pain they are often obscured by bowel gas and not readily seen. For this reason, the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis and renal colic on US is often made by secondary ﬁndings such as hydronephrosis. 6 Other diagnostic dilemmas in utilizing renal US to diagnose nephro- lithiasis are the relative inaccuracy of predicting stone passage and the inability to evaluate for alternate causes of ﬂank pain, such as AAA. Although CT may help to predict stone passage and evaluate the aorta, with a recurrent stone rate of 50% in most patients, per- 127 forming CT scans on every patient with every presentation of ﬂank pain would lead to astronomical radiation exposure. 7 This chapter will focus on the means by which a clinician can apply bedside US to evaluate patients with ﬂank pain and suspected kidney stones, while attempting to minimize the risk of missed diagnoses and improper treatment of impassible stones. 128 TWO PORTIONS OF KIDNEY: Renal parenchyma Collecting system Hydronephrosis is dilation of the collecting system SECTION 2 Renal Anatomy The kidneys can be divided into two portions: the renal parenchyma and the collecting system. The renal parenchyma includes the cor- tex, which contains the ﬁltration components of the glomerulus and the medulla. This is the area where the nephrons are located. The medulla contains the medullary pyramids, which are prominent hy- poechoic structures seen on ultrasound, especially in the setting of hydronephrosis. The medullary pyramids contain the distal portions of the nephron and secrete urine into the minor calyces. The collecting system begins with the minor calyces and ends at the hilum of the kidney where the ureter joins the renal pelvis. There are approximately 8-18 minor calyces that eventually coalesce into major calyces, which drain into the ureter (Images 7.1-7.3). 7 129 IMAGE 7.1 The renal cortex is a bright, or hyperechoic, structure with a ground-glass appearance that is located peripherally to the me- dulla. Typically, the renal cortex is just slightly darker than the liver or spleen, which are both readily available for compari- son, as these organs are used as acoustic windows for visuali- zation. The renal cortex is ap- proximately 1-2 cm in width (Movie 7.1).8 The renal pelvis is brighter, or more hyperechoic, than the cortex and is located centrally. The renal pyramids surround the pelvis and collecting system, which is often not visible in the normal kidney with- out hydronephrosis. Conversely, in the setting of obstruction and thus hydronephrosis, the collecting system is a dilated, ﬂuid ﬁlled, and an- echoic structure that dominates the central portion of the kidney (Im- age 7.3 and 7.4). \t Although kidney measurements are not typically performed at the bedside in clinical evaluation of ﬂank pain, they can be helpful in the evaluation of other pathology such as causes of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Normal kidneys measure 9-12cm in length and 4-5cm 130 IMAGE 7.2 - Hydronephrosis IMAGE 7.3 MOVIE 7.1 - Normal kidney in width with less than a 2cm variation when compared to the pa- tient’s other kidney.9 A large kidney suggests acute renal congestion from causes such as thrombosis, pyelonephritis, or acute renal failure. 10 Conversely, smaller kidneys suggest poor function and CKD. The appearance and size of the renal cortex can also identify pathol- ogy. Normally, the thickness of the renal cortex is 1-2cm. A thin cor- tex can be seen in severe hydronephrosis and in CKD, whereas a large cortex can sometimes be seen with pyelonephritis. Finally, the difference in echogenicity between the cortex and the pelvis should be well demarcated in a normal kidney. However, chronic kidney dis- ease can obscure this demarcation and cause the kidney to have uni- formed echogenicity.11 131 IMAGE 7.4 One Minute Ultrasound Renal Ultrasound Demo SUMMARY Curvilinear probe is preferred Image in two planes The left kidney is more posterior and superior Image bladder in transverse and longitudinal orientation Have a very low threshold for imaging the aorta in a patient with ﬂank pain SECTION 3 Image Acquisition The curvilinear probe is ideal for imaging the kid- neys. It uses a lower fre- quency and thus has im- proved penetration. This is necessary due to the retroperitoneal location of the kidneys, which must be imaged through acoustic windows such as the liver and the spleen. In situations where a cur- vilinear probe is not avail- able, a phased array probe may be used as it also has a lower frequency (Gallery 71.). \t 132 Renal How-to Video MOVIE 7.2 Curvilinear transducer GALLERY 7.1 The right kidney should be approached by placing the probe at the midaxillary line at the most inferior intercostal space. The probe marker should initially be oriented towards the patient’s head. Often a slight counterclockwise twist will allow the probe footprint to align between the ribs and obliterate any rib shadows in the image. From this position, the probe should be rocked from superior to inferior pole of the kidney and fanned from anterior to posterior to evaluate the entire kidney. Each kidney should be visualized completely in two planes. Thus, after this longitudinal view is obtained, the probe marker should be oriented anteriorly to create a transverse view of the kidney. Again, the probe should be fanned superior and inferior to visualize the entire kidney (Image 7.6, 7.7 and Movie 2.3). \t The left kidney uses the spleen as the acoustic window and is there- fore more challenging. The probe should be initially placed over the posterior axillary line at the second most inferior intercostal space. Again, the probe will be oriented with the marker towards the pa- tient’s head and then anteriorly. The kidney should be visualized en- tirely in both longitudinal and transverse orientation (Images 7.8, 7.9, and Movie 7.4) . 133 Longitudinal probe placement IMAGE 7.5 Transverse probe placement IMAGE 7.6 MOVIE 7.3 - Normal right kidney \t The bladder is another important structure that should be imaged when assessing for causes of hydronephrosis, renal colic and renal failure. To image the bladder, place the probe just superior to the pubis symphysis and direct the beam of the probe inferi- orly, down into the pelvis. Acquire im- ages in the longitudi- nal and transverse planes (Image 7.10, Movie 7.5 and Image 7.11 and Movie 7.6). 134 IMAGE 7.7 IMAGE 7.8 MOVIE 7.4 - Normal left kidney IMAGE 7.9 MOVIE 7.5 - Longitudinal bladder \t \t The aorta should be imaged in virtually every patient with ﬂank pain and suspected kidney stone.

(Link to Aorta Chapter). 135 IMAGE 7.10 MOVIE 7.6 - Transverse bladder SUMMARY 5-15% of Americans will have a kidney stone at some point in their life The evaluation of renal colic is focused on secondary signs such as hydronephrosis Severe hydronephrosis is characterized by cortical thinning Avoiding CT scans on patients with no or mild hydronephrosis may decrease CT utilization by 73%. Do not confuse cysts with hydronephrosis SECTION 4 Pathology KIDNEY STONES A common indication for bedside renal US is in the evaluation of ﬂank pain and suspected renal colic. It is estimated that 5-15% of Americans will have a kidney stone at some point in their lifetime.5,12 Symptoms of renal colic include: sudden unilateral ﬂank pain, inabil- ity to achieve a comfortable position, radiation of pain to the groin, hematuria/dysuria, and nausea and vomiting. The ultrasound evaluation of renal colic is directed more towards sec- ondary ﬁndings, such as hydronephrosis due to ureteral obstruction. However, kidney stones can sometimes be visualized in the collecting system or in the proximal ureter. Kidney stones appear as hypere- choic structures that vary in size from 1mm-10mm and cast a promi- nent shadow. Unfortunately, US is not reliable at identifying the ac- tual stone. The sensitivity of ultrasound to identify renal stones in the kidney is about 60-67%.13,14 The sensitivity is even worse when diag- nosing ureteral stones. In a study by Smith et al, 6 ultrasound was re- ported to be only 19% sensitive for ﬁnding ureteral stones. Due to the relative insensitivity of US diagnosis of actual stones, the operator should instead depend on the presence of unilateral hy- dronephrosis on the side of pain and a high clinical suspicion for ob- structing ureteral stone as more conclusive proof than visualization of the stone itself. Luckily, bedside US has proven to be highly sensitive for the diagnosis of hydronephrosis. The sensitivity of identiﬁcation of hydronephrosis is 71-97%. 15,16 \t 136 Hydronephrosis is a descriptive ﬁnding, not etiology, caused by ob- struction of the ureter, bladder, or urethra, and thus urine backup into the renal pelvis.  Acutely, this can cause the calyceal system to dilate with urine, which appears anechoic on ultrasound. The severity of hydronephrosis occurs along a spectrum described as mild, moder- ate or severe, which can be delineated by the renal structures that are affected. 17 Hydronephrosis may appear to be absent in the set- ting of ureteral obstruction and volume depletion due to the relative lack of backup of urine into the collecting system. For this reason, many physicians provide a patient with a ﬂuid bolus prior to bedside imaging to improve sensitivity.18 Mild hydronephrosis is characterized by enlargement of the calices with preservation of the renal papillae (Movie 7.7 and 7.8). 17 137 IMAGE 7.11 - Hydronephrosis MOVIE 7.7 - Mild Hydronephrosis MOVIE 7.8 - Mild Hydronephrosis Moderate hydronephrosis is characterized by rounding/blunting of calices with obliteration of the papillae, and often described as hav- ing a bear-claw appearance (Movie 7.9). 10,17 Severe hydronephrosis is the most dramatic and is characterized by caliceal ballooning with cortical thinning (Movies 7.10-7.12).10 138 MOVIE 7.9- Moderate hydronephrosis MOVIE 7.10 - Severe hydronephrosis MOVIE 7.11 - Severe hydronephrosis Unfortunately, there is no correlation between the degree of hy- dronephrosis and renal function, or extent of ureter obstruction.10 However, Goertz and Lotterman reported that the degree of hy- dronephrosis on ultrasound was associated with a proportional in- crease in stone size and thus the likelihood of stone passage.17 Typi- cally, small stones <5mm are expected to pass spontaneously and large stones >10mm require surgical intervention for passage. Go- ertz and Lotterman suggested that patients be separated into less se- vere hydronephrosis (none or mild) and more severe hydronephrosis (moderate to severe). They noted that patients with more severe hy- dronephrosis frequently had large stones (>10mm) that were unlikely to spontaneously pass. Conversely, they also found that patients with less severe hydronephrosis could avoid CT scans during their workup, as there were no patients in this group with nephrolithiasis >10mm. Avoiding CT scans on patients with no or mild hydronephro- sis thus would decrease CT utilization by 73% and only miss 9% of stones >5mm. Figure 2.1 depicts this approach. 10 139 MOVIE 7.12 - Severe hydronephrosis FIGURE 7.1 RENAL CYSTS: \t Renal cysts are the most common renal pathology found on ultrasound. 9 They can be asymptomatic or a cause of ﬂank pain. There are two types of renal cysts, simple or complex. Simple cysts must meet four criteria: 1. Uniform smooth oval shape. 2. Anechoic center without internal echoes or septation. 3. Well-demarcated border separating it from the surrounding renal parenchyma. 4. Posterior acoustic enhancement, as seen with other ﬂuid ﬁlled struc- tures Failure to meet all four of these criteria would constitute a complex cyst. If there is a complex cyst, consider ordering a CT or MRI, as ul- trasound cannot accurately characterize complex cystic masses. 19\t Cortical cysts (Movie 7.13)– note how the anechoic ﬂuid collections are present in the renal parenchyma, not the pelvis. This differenti- ates renal cysts from hydronephrosis. \t 140 MOVIE 7.13 - Cortical cysts Renal cysts can be problematic, as they can be mistaken for hy- dronephrosis. It is important when evaluating for hydronephrosis to image the kidney completely and convince yourself that the ﬂuid ﬁlled structure is within the collecting system, as would be seen with hydronephrosis, and not within the cortex, as would be seen with a cyst. CONCLUSION In conclusion, renal ultrasound can be used to help diagnosis the eti- ology of ﬂank pain. It has the beneﬁt of not subjecting the patient to ionizing radiation, but should be appropriately applied. The aorta should virtually always be visualized to ensure the patients ﬂank pain is not due to aortic pathology. In most cases of ﬂank pain, patients with a history of kidney stones, unilateral mild-moderate hydroneph- rosis and a normal aorta can be treated clinically with appropriate follow-up. A multicenter trial, the Stone Study, is currently investigat- ing the diagnostic accuracy and safety of an ultrasound only ap- proach. \t Tell everyone you ﬁnished another chapter!

While many modern point-of-care ultrasound systems limit the operator’s ability to adjust the various settings, there remain a number of impor- tant features that allow users to customize and, indeed, improve im- aging. This chapter will break down basic ultrasound physics into its essential components, with an emphasis on the core concepts of im- age acquisition as well as the host of imaging artifacts commonly en- countered. The format for the chapter will be a series of bullet points supplemented by images and videos.

Spacial Pulse Length 148 FIGURE 9.4 - Summary of ultrasound physics principles •Pulse duration (PD): length of time from the beginning to the end of \t a pulse (Figure 9.5) \t -\t Determined by the number of cycles (“ringing”), and the \t \t \t period (length of time) of each cycle \t -\t Fewer cycles = ringing \t -\t Each cycle with a shorter period = frequency \t -\t Shorter pulses mean better images. \t -\t PD = # cycles in pulse X period - PD = # cycles in pulse / frequency •Pulse repetition period (PRP): length of time from beginning of   \t \t one pulse to the next (Figure 9.6) \t -\t Similar to period, but PRP includes the pulse duration and \t \t \t the “listening” time. \t -\t Changed by adjusting the maximum imaging depth \t \t \t \t (depth of view) \t -\t Depth then PRP (“listening” time increases) 149 FIGURE 9.5 - Pulse duration FIGURE 9.6 - Pulse repetition period •Pulse repetition frequency (PRF): number of pulses per second   (Figure 9.7) \t -\t Similar to frequency, though PRF refers to pulses/sec \t \t \t \t rather than cycles/sec. \t -\t Changed by adjusting the maximum imaging depth \t \t \t \t (depth of view) \t -\t Depth then PRF (listening time increases) \t -\t PRP (sec) X PRF (Hz) = 1 (inversely related) •Duty factor: the percentage of time spent producing a pulse \t -\t Unit-less, ranges between 1.0 (100%) and 0.0 (0%) \t -\t Changed by adjusting the maximum imaging depth \t \t \t \t (depth of view) \t -\t Generally the duty factor is very low, with only a fraction \t \t \t of time spent transmitting a pulse, and much more \t \t \t \t time listening or receiving. \t -\t Duty factor (%) = PD (sec) / PRP (sec) X 100 \t -\t PRF Duty factor \t -\t Depth Duty factor \t -\t PRP Duty factor \t -\t PD Duty factor 150 FIGURE 9.7 - Pulse repetition frequency •Spatial pulse length (SPL): length or distance of a pulse (8) \t -\t Similar to wavelength \t -\t SPL (mm) = # cycles in pulse X wavelength (mm) \t -\t SPL determine longitudinal resolution (more later) \t -\t SPL ∝ wavelength \t -\t SPL ∝ 1/frequency 151 FIGURE 9.8 - Spatial pulse length FIGURE 9.9 - Summary of pulsed ultrasound parameters •Piezoelectric (“Pressure-Electricity”) effect: Transmission and   Detection \t -\t When an electrical pulse is applied to a material with pie- \t \t \t zoelectric properties, it vibrates. \t -\t These vibrations are transmitted to adjacent tissues as ul-\t \t \t \t trasound (U/S) waves. \t -\t The U/S waves travel through the medium until they en-\t \t \t \t counter a reﬂective surface, and a portion of the \t \t \t \t sound is then reﬂected back to the source (echo). \t \t \t \t (Figure 9.10) \t -\t The returning echo strikes the probe and the piezoelectric \t \t \t material vibrates. This vibration generates an elec-\t \t \t \t trical current. The current is then translated by the \t \t \t \t U/S \t processor into the grayscale seen on the ultra- \t \t \t sound screen. (Figure 9.11) \t -\t The probes are both transmitters and receivers of sound. 152 FIGURE 9.10 - Piezoelectric effect FIGURE 9.11 - Returning signal SUMMARY:  Important terms: Attenuation Refraction Impedance Angle of insonation  Resolution SECTION 2 Imaging •Image Depth: Calculated by the US machine by the time   elapsed between signal pulse and the received echo •Direction: the crystals precisely differentiate the direction of the \t \t returning echoes •\t The returning echo intensity is proportional to the grayscale as \t \t signment of the pixel (dot) of information on the screen; \t \t \t stronger signal, more echoes = brighter dot. •\t The surface area of a transducer in contact with the patient is \t \t \t referred to as the “footprint” of the probe.

Time gain com- pensation is used to adjust for this. MOVIE 9.1 Angle of insonation (angle of incidence): (Figure 9.15 and Movie 9.2) •\t The angle between the incident ultrasound beam and an imagi- \t \t nary line that is perpendicular to the boundary of the ob- \t \t ject of interest; important for deﬁning the boundaries of a \t \t vessel for a vascular study. •\t Translated: need to scan perpendicular to object of interest to \t \t \t maximize returning echoes and improve image quality. Resolution: •\t The ability of the sound waves to discriminate between two dif- \t \t \t ferent, closely spaced objects •\t Axial resolution = refers to the ability to distinguish between \t \t \t two closely spaced objects in a plane parallel to the ultra- \t \t sound beam (resolve shallower and deeper object); also \t \t known as longitudinal resolution. (Gallery 9.1) \t -\t The spatial pulse length is the major determinant of axial \t \t \t resolution; shorter pulses provide better images. 156 FIGURE 9.15 - Angle of insonation (incidence) Note the clearer margins to the abdominal aorta as the angle of insonation is adjusted. MOVIE 9.2 \t -\t The higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength and \t \t \t spatial pulse length, resulting in better axial resolu-\t \t \t \t tion. •\t Lateral resolution = refers to the ability to distinguish between \t \t \t two closely spaced objects in the horizontal tissue plane \t \t \t (perpendicular to the ultrasound beam) (Gallery 9.1) \t -\t The width of the ultrasound beam (array of crystals, dis-\t \t \t \t tance between individual crystal rays or scan line \t \t \t \t density) is the major determinant of lateral resolu-\t \t \t \t tion. \t -\t More focal zones allows for enhanced resolution at par-\t \t \t \t ticular depths of the scanning area, improving the \t \t \t \t lateral resolution; there is also some beneﬁt to in\t \t \t \t creasing the transducer frequency and decreasing \t \t \t \t the gain. •\t Temporal resolution = ability to detect the position of moving \t \t \t objects at various points in time (Gallery 9.1) \t -\t Synonymous with frame rate \t -\t More frames/second leads to better temporal resolution;   lower frame rates make the video appears choppy   \t or stuttering. \t -\t Improved by narrowing the imaging sector, decreasing \t \t \t \t scanning depth, decreasing the line density, and de- \t \t \t creasing the number of focal zones. \t -\t Especially important in cardiac ultrasound 157 Axial resolution GALLERY 9.1 Various Resolutions Scanning Modes: B-mode Ultrasound: •\t Grayscale ultrasound (Figure 9.16) •\t Most common scanning mode •\t “B” = Brightness •\t Strong echoes are represented by white dots. •\t Absence of echoes are represented by black dots. •\t Terminology: (Figure 9.17) \t -\t Echogenic = bright (white) objects \t -\t Anechoic = dark (black) objects \t -\t Hyperechoic = brighter (more white) than comparison \t \t\t\t structure \t -\t Hypoechoic = darker (more black) than comparison struc- \t\t\t ture \t -\t Isoechoic = same echogenicity as comparison structure M-mode Ultrasound: (Figure 9.18) •\t B-mode scanning appears on the left, while a tracing of tissue movement over time appears on the right (depth and time). 158 FIGURE 9.16 - B-mode ultrasound of the aorta FIGURE 9.17 Echogenicity examples •\t Vertical axis is depth and corresponds to the B-mode image. •\t Horizontal axis represents time. •\t Particularly useful in fetal heart rate measurements and cardiac \t \t imaging Color Doppler: (Figure 9.19) •\t Measures mean velocity and direction of ﬂow, superimposing color over a B-Mode image •\t A color scale display on the side of the screen gives infor- mation on mean veloc- ity. •\t The color superiorly represents ﬂow toward the probe, and   inferiorly represents ﬂow away from the probe. 159 FIGURE 9.18 - M-mode being used to determine a fetal heart rate FIGURE 9.19 Color flow doppler of the upper thigh Color flow doppler of the carotid artery.

Important Knobs: •\t Power: The total energy delivered by the transducer; increas-\t \t \t ing the power increases the intensity of the ultrasound \t \t \t beam. Typically, the power is ﬁxed to limit potential ad-\t \t \t verse biologic effects. •\t Gain: Degree of ampliﬁcation of the returning signal. Adjust\t \t \t ments to gain increase or decrease the overall brightness \t \t of returning echoes on the screen. Analogous to the vol-\t \t ume knob on a stereo. •\t Time Gain Compensation: Typically, a series of “sliders” arranged vertically, allowing preferential adjustments of gain at different levels of tissue. Also known as TGC. (Image 9.1) 161 IMAGE 9.1 Time gain compensation sliders Adjusting time gain compensation in the far field, and then then near field. MOVIE 9.5 \t •Depth: Adjusts the ﬁeld of view to increase or decrease the \t \t \t scanning area. •Frequency: Adjusts the frequency of sound emitted by the \t \t \t probe. The higher the frequency, the better the reso-   lution and the lower the penetration. •Focus: Improves image resolution at a particular level (depth) \t of the ultrasound screen. Often appears to the right   of the image as an arrow (or group of arrows/foci). •\t Dynamic Range: The range of returning echo intensities that \t \t \t the machine processes in forming the grayscale image \t \t \t (measured in decibels, 30-78 dB). If you decrease the dy \t \t namic range, the weaker signals in the spectrum are lost, \t \t and there will be greater contrast between black and \t \t \t white (good for vascular studies). A higher dynamic \t \t \t range will give you more “shades of gray,” hence more \t \t \t detail regarding the tissue imaged. •\t Tissue harmonics: The transducer listens for sound waves re-\t \t \t turning at twice the frequency of the pulse that was emit\t - \t \t ted from the transducer (the second harmonic). This “har- \t \t monic frequency” is less susceptible to distortion as com-\t \t pared to the traditional frequency; mainly echoes from \t \t \t deeper structures. Artifacts due to side lobes and scatter \t \t are greatly reduced, and are subject to less attenuation. Basics to Scanning: The Probes: (Gallery 9.2) 162 Curvilinear probe and footprint GALLERY 9.2 Various Probes •\t It is important to note that the range of frequencies for the vari- \t \t ous probes is quite variable, depending on the particular \t \t ultrasound manufacturer. •\t Curved array probe: \t -\t Low frequency (common frequency range of 2 to 5 MHz) \t -\t Sector scanning format \t -\t Large footprint and scanning area, though decreased \t \t \t resolution with increasing depth. \t -\t Ideal for all abdominal, retroperitoneal, and OB/GYN \t \t \t studies. •\t Phased array probe: \t -\t Low frequency (common frequency range 1 to 5 MHz) \t -\t Sector scanning format \t -\t Smaller footprint than the curved array \t -\t Ideal for cardiac studies •\t Endocavitary probe: \t -\t Moderate frequency (common frequency range of 8 to \t \t\t 15 MHz) \t -\t Small footprint, great resolution \t -\t Ideal for intraoral or transvaginal studies •\t Linear array probe: \t -\t Higher frequency (common frequency range 5 to 15 MHz) \t -\t Arrays are paral- lel, maintaining resolution with increasing depth. \t -\t Scanning area is limited to the size of the probe. \t -\t Probe of choice 163 FIGURE 9.22 - Imaging planes Moving between a transverse (short-axis) plane to a longitu- dinal (long-axis) plane.

(Movie 9.6) 164 Acoustic shadowing (arrowheads) from gallstones GALLERY 9.3 Artifacts Acoustic shadowing from a large gallstone. MOVIE 9.7 Femoral vessels obscurred by gain ar- tifact, with improved visualization as the gain is turned down. MOVIE 9.8 •\t Gain artifact: Excessive ampliﬁcation of the returning echo, \t \t \t such that it may obscure anechoic structures. Again, \t \t \t blood/ﬂuid should be black. Underlying vascular struc-\t \t \t tures may not be identiﬁed if the gain is too high. (Movie  9.7) •\t Posterior Acoustic Enhancement: Certain media allow efﬁcient \t \t propagation of ultrasound waves (pleural effusions, ab-\t \t \t scesses, abdominal free ﬂuid, large vessels or ﬂuid-ﬁlled \t \t \t organs, etc.). With this increased “through transmission,” \t \t the tissue behind the media appears more echogenic as \t \t \t compared to the surrounding tissue. In other words, \t \t \t there is less attenuation of the ultrasound wave as it \t \t \t propagates through these types of media. 165 Posterior acoustic enhancement from a cutaneous ab- scess MOVIE 9.9 Reverberation artifact noted on gallbladder exam (extend- ing into the lumen of the gallbladder). MOVIE 9.10 •\t Reverberation: Occurs when there are two reﬂectors that line \t \t \t parallel to one another and perpendicular to the US \t \t \t wave. Sound gets trapped between these two highly \t \t \t echogenic surfaces, bouncing back and forth (think ping- \t \t pong) before ﬁnally returning back to the probe. As \t \t \t depth on the US screen is determined by the time elapsed \t \t from pulse initiation to reception, the returning echoes \t \t \t are displayed as recurrent bright lines similar to the rungs \t \t of a ladder (parallel and equidistant). •\t Ring Down or Comet Tailing: Two different forms of reverbera\t \t \t tion artifact. Both occur in the setting of two or more \t \t \t strong reﬂectors that are both very close together, and \t \t \t exist in a medium with high propagation speeds. Ring-\t \t \t down artifacts occur with small structures (gas bub-\t \t \t ble or, classically, a hollow-bore needle tip) that produce \t \t a long, linear echo from the structure. The reverberations \t \t of comet tail artifacts are so closely spaced that they actu- \t \t ally merge. These may be seen with small, strong reﬂec\t- \t \t tors such as air, plastic, metal, and calciﬁcations. •\t Mirror artifact: objects appear on both sides of a strong reﬂec- \t \t tor (such as the diaphragm). Occurs when an ultrasound \t \t wave strikes the strong reﬂector, and a portion of the \t \t \t wave does not travel directly back to the transducer. In\t \t \t stead, it may bounce between the two reﬂective surfaces, \t \t resulting in more time elapsed. Thus, the mirror image \t \t \t (or false image) is displayed on the opposite side of the \t \t\t reﬂector. •\t Lateral cystic shadowing (edge artifact): Sound   waves encountering a rounded or curved struc-   ture, particularly with differing propagation   speeds, result in refraction of thewave that does   not return to the probe.   166 Ring-down artifact from an 18 gauge angiocatheter. MOVIE 9.12 Comet tail artifact on thoracic ultrasound of a patient with pulmonary edema. MOVIE 9.11 Since the wave does not return to the probe, shadow is   seen along the edge.

Ideally, a ﬂuid challenge increases stroke volume (SV), and thereby increases cardiac output. However, in some circumstances, a ﬂuid challenge may be ineffective or harmful.1-3 A patient receiving ﬂuid for septic shock may not be ﬂuid responsive after receiving multiple ﬂuid chal- lenges. A patient in cardiogenic shock with pulmonary edema may suffer additional harm by unnecessary administration of intravenous ﬂuid. It is important that the clinician be able to properly assess a patient’s likelihood to respond to a ﬂuid challenge. Newer methods incorporating ultrasound into the bedside evaluation may offer a su- perior assessment than conventional methods. 173 SUMMARY CVP is an inadequate assessment of ﬂuid responsiveness SECTION 2 CVP and PAOP Traditional methods of assessment of ﬂuid response have relied on measuring cardiac ﬁlling pressures as a way to gauge preload. Cen- tral venous pressure (CVP) is a surrogate for right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic pressure, and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure is a surrogate for left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure. Maestrini’s Law of the Heart (commonly called the Frank-Starling law) demon- strates that the relationship between ventricular end-diastolic pressure and ventricular end-diastolic volume (cardiac preload) is not linear (Figure 13.1).4,5 At low ﬁlling pressures, one may get large in- creases in SV for an incremental increase in ﬁlling pressure. At high pressures, one may get a minimal increase (or occasionally a de- crease) in SV for the same increase in ﬁlling pressure. It is for this reason that CVP and pulmonary artery ﬁlling pressures are not accu- rate predictors of ﬂuid responsiveness, despite their widespread clini- cal use. 6- 174 FIGURE 13.1 - Frank Starling curve SUMMARY Advantages of Ultrasound over traditional methods of assessing ﬂuid response: Visualization of ventricular chamber Ability to quantify parameters that vary dynamically During respiration, the changes in intrathoracic pressure affect preload. SECTION 3 Assessing fluid responsive- ness with ultrasound Ultrasound offers several advantages over traditional methods of as- sessing ﬂuid response. The ability to qualitatively visualize the ven- tricular chamber is sometimes more informative of cardiac preload than a measurement of its pressure. Perhaps more important is the ability of ultrasound to quantify parameters that vary dynamically with a perturbation of the cardiac ﬁlling pressures. The ability to measure dynamic parameters may inform the clinician whether the patient is situated on the steep part of the Frank-Starling curve or the plateau (Figure 13.2). During respiration, the changes in intrathoracic pressure affect pre- load. In a passively mechanically ventilated patient who is ﬂuid re- 175 FIGURE 13.2 - Frank starling curve with dynamic parame- ters sponsive, inspiration increases intrathoracic pressures, which reduces RV preload and SV. After two or three cardiac cycles, this de- creased RV stroke volume leads to a decrease in LV preload and stroke volume, which are often observed during expiration. In the same patient, inspiration will lead to increased LV preload and SV due to increased pulmonary venous return of blood (Figure 13.3). In a patient who is passively mechanically ventilated and ﬂuid respon- sive, respiration will induce cyclical changes in SV. In a ﬂuid respon- sive patient who is not receiving any positive pressure ventilation, in- spiration will decrease intrathoracic pressures. SV will still vary with respiration, but will be reversed when compared to the changes noted in the passively mechanically ventilated patient. Caution must be applied when evaluating the use of parameters that vary with respiration in the patient who is spontaneously breathing. The tidal volumes and deﬂections of intrathoracic pressures are incon- sistent in the spontaneously breathing patient. Patients who are re- ceiving an assisted mode of ventilation or non-invasive positive pres- sure ventilation may have more complex hemodynamic effects than either unassisted breathing or passive ventilation. 10,11 176 FIGURE 13.3 - Respiratory Variation of Stroke Volume SUMMARY Ultrasound evaluation of the IVC may inform the clinician of the CVP However, CVP is not terribly useful to predict ﬂuid responsive- ness In mechanically ventilated patients a vena cava that distends >18% with passive respiration predicts ﬂuid responsiveness SECTION 4 Inferior Vena Cava The inferior vena cava (IVC) is a highly compliant blood vessel that empties into the right atrium (RA). Ultrasound evaluation of the IVC may inform the clinician of the CVP.12 (Illustration 13.1, Movie 13.1 an d 1 3 .2 )   177 MOVIE 13.1 - IVC collapsing ILLUSTRATION 13.1 IVC diameter (cm) Collapse with sniff CVP (mmHg) < 2.1 >50% 0-5 5-10 >2.1 <50% >10 The utility of an ultrasonic estimation of CVP is limited, as CVP is not a terribly useful parameter to predict ﬂuid responsiveness. The IVC runs longitudinally along the spine. The appropriate method to iden- tify the IVC uses either a cardiac or abdominal 2-D ultrasound in the subcostal window. The measurement should be made perpendicular to the long axis of the IVC at end-expiration, just cephalad to the junction of the hepatic veins that lie approximately 5-30 mm proximal to the ostium of the RA (Image 13.1). It is important to not mistake lateral translation of the IVC for collapse (Movie 13.3). Evaluation of respiratory collapse is performed in the non-intubated patient by requesting that the patient perform a sniff maneuver. The degree of IVC collapse is not a reliable estimate of CVP in a patient receiving mechanical ventilation, but it is reasonable in these patients to expect that CVP will be <10 mm Hg if the IVC diameter is < 12mm. 13 178 MOVIE 13.2 - Plethoric IVC IMAGE 13.1 - Appropriate location for IVC measure- ment MOVIE 13.3 - Lateral movement of IVC in longitudinal plane Although the utility of an estimated CVP is limited, ultrasound can be very informative in predicting ﬂuid response. Barbier and colleagues demonstrated that in mechanically ventilated patients, a vena cava that distends > 18% in diameter (Figure 13.4) with passive respira- tion is likely to respond to a ﬂuid challenge.14 In a similar study com- prised solely of septic patients receiving mechanical ventilation, Feis- sel and colleagues demonstrated that a passively ventilated patient with an IVC variability > 12% (Figure 13.5) was likely to respond to ﬂuid. 15 The IVC may not be as informative in patients with abdomi- nal compartment syndrome, pregnancy, or high airway pressures.\t \t 179 FIGURE 13.5 FIGURE 13.4 One Minute Ultrasound IVC Ultrasound Demonstration SUMMARY There is growing interest in using ultrasonography of the inter- nal jugular (IJ) vein to assess ﬂuid responsiveness. Historically, clinical assessment of a patient’s volume status included an as- sessment of jugular venous pulsation, a measurement of mar- ginal accuracy and reproducibility. 16 One might surmise that ultrasound evidence of a collapsing or plethoric IJ vein would be as informative as the vena cava. Some clinicians in practice are using ultrasound to predict ﬂuid responsiveness by respira- tory collapse of the internal jugular. At the time of writing this text, there is insufﬁcient evidence to support this practice. SECTION 5 Internal Jugular Vein 180 SUMMARY Diastolic function is helpful in determining the risk of a ﬂuid chal- lenge, but does not adequately assess ﬂuid responsiveness. Apical 4-chamber view is used to obtain the mitral inﬂow veloc- ity The mitral annulus tissue doppler is also obtained in the apical 4-chamber view SECTION 6 Diastolic Function Assessment of left ventricular diastolic function can be performed us- ing pulse wave Doppler of the mitral inﬂow and the tissue Doppler of the mitral annulus (Figure 13.6).17 While not every patient’s diastology is easily categorized, one can use the ratio of mitral inﬂow velocity (E) to mitral annulus velocity (e’) during early diastole to estimate left atrial pressures. 18 181 FIGURE 13.6 The mitral inﬂow velocity is obtained by transthoracic echocardiogra- phy in the apical 4-chamber (A4C) view, or by transesophageal echocardiography in the midesophageal 4-chamber view. (Gallery 13.1) The pulse wave Doppler, with a 1-3mm sample volume, is placed be- tween the mitral leaﬂet tips during diastole.17 The mitral annulus tis- sue Doppler is obtained by transthoracic echocardiography in the A4C view, or by transesophageal echocardiography in the mideso- phageal 4-chamber view. (Gallery 13.1) The tissue Doppler sample volume is positioned at or within 1 cm of the septal mitral annulus and adjusted to cover the longitudinal excur- sion of the mitral annulus (usually 5-10 mm).17 The E/e’ ratio offers a reasonable estimate of left atrial pressure. An E/e’ ratio < 8 is 182 MOVIE 13.4 - Lung Ultrasound showing pulmonary edema The mitral inflow velocity is obtained by transthoracic echo- cardiography in the apical 4-chamber (A4C) view, or by transesophageal echocardiography in the midesophageal 4- chamber view GALLERY 13.1 One Minute Ultrasound Diastology Demonstration likely to correlate to a normal left atrial pressure. Conversely, an E/ e’ ratio > 15 is likely to correlate to an elevated left atrial pressure. 18 Although an assessment of diastolic function and an estimate of left atrial pressure may not necessarily inform the clinician of the likeli- hood of the patient to respond to ﬂuid, these data are useful when weighing the potential harms of administering a ﬂuid challenge. A patient with an elevated left atrial pressure is at increased risk for pul- monary edema, a ﬁnding that can also be assessed with ultrasound (Movies 13.4 and 13.5).19 183 MOVIE 13.5 - Normal Lung Ultrasound SUMMARY Stroke volume can be measured using pulse wave Doppler of the LVOT in a parasternal long-axis view Stroke volume variation and aortic ﬂow velocity variations pre- dict ﬂuid responsiveness in passively breathing, mechanically ventilated patients. SECTION 7 Stroke volume, Aortic blood velocity variation A clinician can determine left ventricular stroke volume using pulse wave Doppler of the left ventricular outﬂow tract (LVOT). The LVOT diameter is measured from a parasternal long-axis view (transtho- racic) or midesophageal long-axis view (transesophageal) (Figure 13.7, Movies 13.6 and 13.7). 184 FIGURE 13.7 - Parasternal long-axis view MOVIE 13.6 - Parasternal long-axis view The velocity-time integral (VTI) of LVOT blood velocity is obtained us- ing pulse wave Doppler from a transthoracic apical 5-chamber or apical long axis view (Image 13.4) or from a deep transgastric ﬁve chamber view (Movie 13.8 and Image 13.3). 185 MOVIE 13.7 - PLAX With LVOT Diameter IMAGE 13.2 - LVOT VTI From Apical 5 Chamber MOVIE 13.8 - LVOT VTI From Deep Transgastric IMAGE 13.3 Accurate assessment of SV requires that the pulse wave is placed at the same location where the LVOT diameter is measured. The angle of insonation can greatly affect the velocity of blood ﬂow, which can alter the measured stroke volume (Image 13.4 and Figure 13.8). If the angle of insonation is < 15° from the direction of ﬂow, the meas- ured velocity is > 97% of the true velocity. \t The clinician can use respiratory variation in SV to assess a pa- tient’s likelihood to respond to ﬂuid (Images 13.5 and 13.6, Figure 13.9). As the LVOT diameter does not vary with respiration, stroke volume variation is essentially the variation in VTI. As stated above, the angle of insonation will affect the measurement of velocity. How- ever, even if the clinician insonates with an angle >15° from the true direction of ﬂow, it will scale down the measurement equally. Hence, a measurement of velocity that is off by 45° will be consistently de- creased by 30% throughout the entire respiratory cycle. The stroke volume will not be accurate, but the SV variation will remain accu- rate. \t Measuring stroke volume in real-time requires calculation of the velocity-time integral, which requires a software package capable of 186 IMAGE 13.4 FIGURE 13.8 - Diagram of the Angle of Insonation, cosθ performing these calculations. In some instances, longitudinal move- ment of the heart may result in difﬁculty with appropriate placement of the sample volume of the pulse wave Doppler. Pulse wave Dop- pler is also subject to aliasing, which may make measurement of the velocity-time integral difﬁcult or impossible (Image 13.7). 187 IMAGE 13.5 - LVOT VTI With Respiratory Varia- tion IMAGE 13.6 - LVOT Without Respiratory Varia- tion FIGURE 13.9 IMAGE 13.7 - Aliased LVOT VTI, With Merging of the Peak With the Aliased Peak. Perhaps a more useful surrogate measurement is the variation of maximum aortic blood velocity, using continuous wave Doppler. In most patients without signiﬁcant aortic stenosis, the peak aortic blood velocity will be proportional to the stroke volume (Images 13.8 and 13.9, Figure 13.10). Measurement of aortic blood velocity avoids the problems of aliasing and longitudinal movement of the heart. An- other advantage is that a clinician may easily estimate peak velocity variation at bedside without use of a software package. \t Ultrasound assessment of stroke volume variation, or its surro- gate measurement of aortic velocity variation, appears to be informa- tive of ﬂuid responsiveness for select populations. In passively venti- lated patients with septic shock, an aortic blood velocity variation threshold > 12% obtained by transthoracic echocardiography indi- cated a strong likelihood for ﬂuid responsiveness.20 A similar study was performed by Monnet and colleagues, using transesophageal assessment of aortic velocity variation. In that study, passively venti- lated ICU patients were likely to respond to ﬂuid if their aortic veloc- ity variation was > 18%. 21 The use of aortic velocity variation or echocardiographic stroke vol- ume variation is not generalizable to all patients. These indices are not useful in a patient with an irregular ventricular rhythm, such as atrial ﬁbrillation or frequent premature ventricular contractions. In such patients, SV will vary depending on diastolic ﬁlling time, and will not be informative of ﬂuid responsiveness. For clinicians measur- ing Doppler velocities with transthoracic echocardiography, care 188 IMAGE 13.8 IMAGE 13.9 FIGURE 13.10 must be taken to ensure that the angle of the probe remains the same throughout the respiratory cycle, as alteration in the angle of insona- tion may alter the measured velocity. In the same vein, a patient with signiﬁcant cardiac translation (e.g., a patient with electrical alter- nans in the setting of a large pericardial effusion) may appear to have large variations in aortic blood velocity, when in reality the only thing that varies is the angle of insonation. Perhaps the most im- portant limitation to the generalizability of ultrasonic assessment of stroke volume variation or aortic velocity variation is that the studies in this area are limited to passively breathing, mechanically venti- lated patients. Thus, in a patient who is breathing spontaneously, these indices have not been validated. One study, by Skulec and col- leagues, has looked at these indices in spontaneously breathing healthy volunteers who were synchronizing their breathing to a met- ronome to decrease breath-to-breath variability. In these patients, a stroke volume variation of > 17% or an aortic velocity variation >14% predicted ﬂuid response. 22 189 SUMMARY Hyperdynamic hypovolemia is usually associated with preload sensitivity The literature surrounding the usefulness of visual estimation of the LV for ﬂuid responsiveness is conﬂicting SECTION 8 Ventricular Size \t Ultrasound can easily obtain images of the heart, whether by transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography. A clinician can identify hyperdynamic hypovolemia on echocardiography, a ﬁnding that is usually associated with preload sensitivity (Movies 13.9 and 13.10). While it may at ﬁrst seem that a visual estimate of the LV would be the best method of assess- ing ﬂuid responsive- ness, the literature surrounding t his ar e co n ﬂict in g. R e u t e r a n d c o l- leagues demon- strated that left ven- t r i c u l a r e n d - diastolic area was able t o pr e dict ﬂuid responsiveness.23 Contrarily, multiple studies have demon- strated that echo- cardiographic meas- urement of the left ventricular area or vo l u m e a t e n d - diastole is not use- ful to predict ﬂuid response. 20,24-26 190 MOVIE 13.9 - Normal vs. Hyperdynamic Hy- povolemia in PSAX MOVIE 13.10 SUMMARY CO and Aortic Velocity with passive leg raise is the only maneu- ver shown to be accurate in predicting ﬂuid responsiveness in spontaneously breathing patients Passive leg raise is effectively a reversible ﬂuid bolus Increase in stroke volume >12.5% correlates with ﬂuid respon- siveness SECTION 9 Passive Leg Raise The passive leg raise is a maneuver performed at bedside, which will result in immediate distribution of approximately 300 mL of whole blood into the central venous system. The advantage of this maneu- ver is that it is effectively a reversible ﬂuid challenge. It is done by assessing cardiac output or SV with the head of the bed elevated to 45°. The head of the bed is immediately lowered to 0° and the legs are elevated 45° for 2 minutes (Figures 13.11 and 13.12). 191 FIGURE 13.11 FIGURE 13.12 The cardiac output or stroke volume is measured again. A patient who has a signiﬁcant increase in either of these measurements is likely to respond to a ﬂuid challenge. A key advantage of the pas- sive leg raise is its applicability in the spontaneously breathing pa- tient. Lamia and colleagues used the passive leg raise in spontane- ously breathing critically ill patients and demonstrated that an in- crease in stroke volume > 12.5% correlated wit h ﬂuid responsiveness.27 Historically, the passive leg raise has been applied successfully in a variety of clinical scenarios, although the application of echocardiography with the passive leg raise is rather recent. One difﬁculty with transthoracic echocardiographic assessment of stroke volume or cardiac output in the passive leg raise is the possibility to alter the angle of insonation during the maneuver. If the heart expe- riences translational movement during the maneuver, the measured change in SV could be erroneous. Similarly, if the clinician does not ensure that the probe angulation and location are exactly the same before and after the maneuver, the measurements could be errone- ous. The passive leg raise also may not be useful in patients with ab- dominal compartment syndrome or pregnancy. 192 One Minute Ultrasound Passive Leg Raise Demo SUMMARY Ultrasound is a useful tool for the clinician faced with the di- lemma of whether or not he or she should administer a ﬂuid challenge. In patients who are receiving passive ventilation from mechanical ventilation, the degree of stroke volume varia- tion and the degree of IVC collapse correlate with likelihood to respond to ﬂuid. In spontaneously breathing patients, an in- crease in SV following a passive leg raise is a good method to predict ﬂuid response. Ultrasound may also be useful in detect- ing elevated left atrial pressure and pulmonary edema, a fre- quent complication of ﬂuid administration.

This chapter is an introduction to ultrasound-guided nerve blocks for the upper extremity,1 and is in- tended to introduce providers to basic concepts, rather than serve as a comprehensive resource. GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND SAFETY CONCERNS Emergency providers should be familiar with the use of local anes- thetic agents and aware of the cardio- and neuro-toxic properties of the particular agent they choose. Patients should be placed on a car- diac monitor and intravenous access obtained. After examination and consent to the procedure, it is often advantageous to administer an anxiolytic and opioid analgesic or low-dose ketamine. Clinically signiﬁcant peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is a rare event,2,3 but care must be taken to inject anesthetic just outside of the epineurium and to attempt to avoid intraneural injection. If the patient reports painful paresthesias, high injection pressures or other worrisome symptoms, the injection should be stopped and the needle repositioned. In addi- tion, post-block neurologic examination and proper instructions for patients regarding care of the blocked limb are essential, as is com- munication with any consulting services who may care for the pa- tient. Although ultrasound -guidance in conjunction with appropriate agents and dosing should be sufﬁcient to prevent local anesthetic sys- temic toxicity (LAST),4 lipid emulsion products and standard ACLS 201 equipment should be readily available in the case of an unantici- pated event. 5,6,7 SET-UP AND EQUIPMENT The ultrasound system should be positioned on the opposite side of the patient from the provider, with the screen in good position to al- low optimal movement of the provider’s visual axis between patient and display. Standard long-beveled facet needles can be used, al- though short-beveled blunt needles may be preferable, if available, as there is some limited evidence that they are less likely to produce PNI. 8,9 The provider may choose to perform the procedure as a sin- gle operator, with needle directly attached to syringe (hand-on- syringe technique). Alternatively, the procedure may be performed with an assistant, with needle attached to extension tubing and sy- ringe, and the assistant responsible for aspirating and injecting from the syringe (hand-on-needle technique). For single-shot injections, as opposed to catheter placements for anesthetic infusions, the use of sterile gloves, sterile preparation of the skin with chlorhexidine, and preparation of the transducer with an adherent sterile dressing and sterile lubricant is considered sufﬁcient antiseptic technique. (Gallery 18.1) BLOCK AFTERCARE AND INTERDISCIPLINARY CONCERNS Thorough documentation of pre- and post-block neurovascular ex- ams is essential. Block type, anesthetic used, and time of block should be noted in the patient’s chart, and the anatomic area should be marked on the patient with a surgical marking pen. Patients should have the affected limb immobilized and be instructed on care of the extremity, including appropriate weight-bearing limitations and follow-up precautions. CHOOSING A BLOCK Blocks of the brachial plexus can be performed at multiple different locations, and choosing the right location for a given patient’s clini- 202 Allow optimal movement of the provider’s visual axis be- tween patient and display. GALLERY 18.1 cal condition is critical to ensure success. In general, the interscalene block is ideal for shoulder and upper arm conditions, the supra- or infra-clavicular block for distal arm, elbow, forearm or wrist injuries, and the axillary block for wrist and hand injuries. Targeted blocks of the median, ulnar and radial nerves in the mid-forearm provide excel- lent anesthesia for hand injuries and procedures, but are not effec- tive for conditions proximal to the hand and will not be covered in this chapter. 203 SUMMARY ED applications: Relief of painful procedures of the shoulder and proximal arm including:  shoulder dislocation  drainage of deltoid abscess  pain relief for proximal and mid-humeral fractures Use color Doppler to identify vessels  Attempt to achieve circumferential spread through the intersca- lene groove  Use 10-15mL of anesthetic   SECTION 2 The Interscalene Block INDICATIONS Pain relief and facilitation of painful procedures in the shoulder and proximal upper arm. Typical ED applications include: reduction of glenohumeral dislocation, drainage of deltoid abscess, pain relief for proximal and mid-humeral fractures. COMPLICATIONS Though low-dose ultrasound-guided blocks may have different char- acteristics, 10 temporary phrenic nerve paralysis is an anticipated com- plication of nerve-stimulator techniques for interscalene block, and providers should avoid this approach in patients with respiratory compromise. Recurrent laryngeal nerve blockade and Horner’s syn- drome can also occur with this approach. SCANNING TECHNIQUE The brachial plexus is identiﬁed in the interscalene groove (between the anterior and middle scalene muscles). (Images 18.1 and 18.2 and Movie 18.1) 204 IMAGE 18.1 IMAGE 18.2 This is best accomplished with a high frequency linear transducer, ori- ented in a transverse plane. (Image 18.3) The appropriate site for injection can be located using the following technique: The great ves- sels (carotid artery and internal jugular vein) are identiﬁed at the level of the larynx, and the transducer is moved laterally until the lat- eral border of the sternocleidomastoid is identiﬁed. The anterior and middle scalene muscles are located deep to the lateral edge of the sternocleidomastoid, and the roots of the brachial plexus are located between these muscles in the interscalene groove. Typically the 5th through 7th cervical roots (C5-C7) are easily seen, oriented in a verti- cal fashion, giving rise to the “trafﬁc light” sign. (Image 18.4) The 8th cervical root (C8) is seen less frequently and should not be confused for the vertebral artery that can sometimes be visualized deep to C7. Care should be taken to use color Doppler to identify any vessels coursing through the target area, as inadvertent intra-arterial injec- tion in the cervical vessels is particularly worrisome for inducing local anesthetic systemic toxicity. INJECTION TECHNIQUE The interscalene block can be performed using an in-plane or out-of- plane technique. The goal is to achieve circumferential spread of lo- cal anesthetic through the interscalene groove. (Movies 18.2 and 18.3) There is tremendous debate about the minimum effective vol- ume (MEV) to achieve a complete interscalene block.11,12 In the emer- gency department (ED), a total volume of 10-15 mL of anesthetic solu- 205 MOVIE 18.1 IMAGE 18.3 IMAGE 18.4 MOVIE 18.2 MOVIE 18.3 tion is almost always sufﬁcient to achieve an adequate level of anal- gesia for facilitation of painful procedures and/or signiﬁcant relief of pain. BLOCK EFFECTS The motor and sensory block associated with the interscalene tech- nique typically affects the shoulder and proximal upper arm more dramatically than the elbow, forearm, wrist or hand. The C8 & T1 dermatomes are often spared, and this block is therefore not ideal for upper arm procedures distal to the upper arm. 206 SUMMARY ED applications:  Reduction of distal humerus fractures  Elbow dislocations  Repair of complex lacerations  I&D of large abscesses or debridement of burns Use color doppler to identify vessels  Use in-plane approach to avoid pleural puncture  10-15mL of anesthetic is usually sufﬁcient SECTION 3 The Supraclavicular Block INDICATIONS The supraclavicular block has been nicknamed “the spinal of the arm” due to the dense degree of anesthesia obtained from the mid- upper arm through the elbow, forearm, wrist and hand. Typical ED applications include: reduction of distal humerus fractures and elbow dislocations, repair of complex lacerations, incision and drainage of large abscesses or debridement of burns. COMPLICATIONS Temporary phrenic nerve paralysis can occur, though less frequently than with the interscalene approach, and providers should generally avoid this block in patients with respiratory compromise. SCANNING TECHNIQUE The brachial plexus is identiﬁed just lateral to the subclavian artery in the supraclavicular fossa. This is best accomplished with a high fre- quency linear transducer, oriented in an oblique coronal plane just cephalad to the clavicle. (Image 18.5) The trunks of the brachial plexus are located just lateral and superﬁcial to the subclavian ar- tery, resting on the ﬁrst rib and superﬁcial to the apex of the lung. 207 IMAGE 18.5 IMAGE 18.6 (Image 18.6 and Movie 18.4) Color Doppler is useful to ensure iden- tiﬁcation of the transverse cervical artery and other arterial struc- tures in the ﬁeld of view. (Movie 18.5) INJECTION TECHNIQUE The supraclavicular block is best performed using an in-plane tech- nique to ensure visualization of the entire needle and to avoid punc- ture of the pleura. The needle is inserted from the lateral aspect of the transducer and the initial injection is ideally performed just deep to the plexus where it rests on the ﬁrst rib, (an added level of protec- tion from pleural violation).13 (Image 18.7 and Image 18.8 and Movie 18.6) The goal is to achieve circumferential spread, and while volumes of approximately 30 mL may be necessary for a complete block,14 a total volume of 10-15 mL of anesthetic solution is almost always sufﬁ- cient to achieve an adequate level of analgesia for facilitation of painful procedures and/or signiﬁcant relief of pain. BLOCK EFFECTS The motor and sensory block associated with the supraclavicular technique typically affects the mid-upper arm, elbow, forearm, wrist and hand. The shoulder is often, but not invariably, affected as well, and should the provider wish to avoid an interscalene block, the su- praclavicular block can represent a potential alternative in these cases. 208 MOVIE 18.4 MOVIE 18.5 IMAGE 18.7 IMAGE 18.8 MOVIE 18.6 SUMMARY ED applications:  Reduction of distal humerus fractures  Elbow dislocations  Repair of complex lacerations  I&D of large abscesses   Debridement of burns 15-20mL of anesthetic is usually sufﬁcient SECTION 4 The Infraclavicular Block INDICATIONS The infraclavicular block results in dense anesthesia from the mid- upper arm through the elbow, forearm, wrist and hand. Typical ED applications include: reduction of distal humerus fractures and elbow dislocations, repair of complex lacerations, incision and drainage of large abscesses or debridement of burns. The lack of phrenic nerve involvement and the ability to perform this block using in-plane or out-of-plane approaches make it an attractive alternative to the supra- clavicular block. SCANNING TECHNIQUE A high frequency linear transducer is placed in the deltopectoral groove, just caudal to the clavicle in a sagittal plane. [FIG13] The lat- eral, posterior and medial cords of the brachial plexus are identiﬁed surrounding the axillary artery, deep to the pectoral major and mi- nor muscles. [VID7] INJECTION TECHNIQUE The infraclavicular block can be performed using an in-plane or out- of-plane technique. Needle visualization can be challenging given the greater target depth as compared to other approaches to the brachial plexus. The goal is to achieve a U-shaped distribution of an- esthetic solution around the axillary artery with a single posterior injection.15,16 [FIG14, VID8] While volumes of approximately 35 mL may be necessary for a complete block, 17 15-20 mL of anesthetic so- lution is almost always sufﬁcient to achieve an adequate level of anal- gesia for facilitation of painful procedures and/or signiﬁcant relief of pain. 209 BLOCK EFFECTS The motor and sensory block associated with the infraclavicular tech- nique typically affects the mid-upper arm, elbow, forearm, wrist and hand. The proximal arm and shoulder are not affected, and this block should not be performed if anesthesia in this region is neces- sary. 210 SUMMARY: ED applications:  Reduction of distal radius fractures  Wrist fractures/dislocations  Repair of complex lacerations The radial, ulnar, median, and musculocutaneous nerves can be identiﬁed 15-20mL of anesthetic is usually sufﬁcient SECTION 5 The Axillary Block Indications: The axillary block targets the peripheral branches of the brachial plexus and results in anesthesia to the forearm, wrist and hand. Typical ED applications include: reduction of distal radius frac- tures, wrist fractures/dislocations, and repair of complex lacerations. If complete forearm anesthesia is desired, the musculocutaneous nerve, which travels in a separate fascial compartment at this level, must be blocked separately from the median, ulnar and radial nerves. Scanning Technique: A high frequency linear transducer is placed in the axilla in a sagittal plane. [FIG15] The radial, ulnar and median nerves are identiﬁed surrounding the axillary artery, [VID9] and the musculocutaneous nerve is visualized separately within the coraco- brachialis muscle. [VID10] Injection Technique: The axillary block can be performed using an in- plane or out-of-plane technique. A total volume of 15-20 mL of anes- thetic solution is almost always sufﬁcient to achieve an adequate level of analgesia. Block Effects: The block associated with the axillary technique typi- cally affects the forearm, wrist and hand. The proximal arm and shoulder are not affected and the elbow is variably affected, and this block should not be performed if anesthesia in these regions is desired.

(Image 24.1) Many of these struc- tures are superﬁcial and can be evaluated with ultrasonogra- phy. The primary structures to be evaluated are the bones, joint capsule, muscles, tendon and bursa. The unaffected hip should be examined for a normal comparison. SECTION 1 Intro 221 IMAGE 24.1 SUMMARY: The high frequency linear probe or curvilinear probe should be used depending on the size of the patient Place the probe at a 30 degree angle to the femur to visualize the hip joint A hip effusion appears convex SECTION 2 Bones The examination of the hip should be focused on a speciﬁc region as directed by clinical ﬁndings. The evaluation of the anterior hip be- gins over the femoral head and neck. The frequency of transducer needed depends on the body habitus of the patient. A high fre- quency linear probe is ideal for enhanced detail of superﬁcial struc- tures in a non-obese patient. (Image 24.2) 222 IMAGE 24.2 - High frequency linear probe On the other hand, a lower frequency, curvilinear probe may be needed in larger patients to achieve the depth needed to perform the exam. (Image 24.3) The proximal femur and the acetabulum of the pelvis make up the hip joint. (Image 24.4). The femoral neck is located in an oblique sagittal plane, approxi- mately 30° off the long axis of the femoral shaft. Visualize the hip joint in long axis, which includes the f e m o r a l h e a d , nec k , a nd a c e- tabulum. (Image 24.5) Use the femoral head as a landmark to ﬁnd this view. The f e m o r a l h e a d should be smooth and uniform and in close approxi- mation to the acetabulum. The hyperechoic, triangular shaped labrum can be visualized between the femur and the acetabulum. (Movie 24.1) 223 IMAGE 24.3 - Curvilinear probe IMAGE 24.4 IMAGE 24.5 - 30 degree off axis of femur MOVIE 24.1 - Normal hip joint The anterior joint capsule extends superﬁcially and caudally to the femoral neck and inserts distally on the intertrochanteric line. A re- ﬂection of the anterior capsule returns posterior to form the posterior joint capsule. 1 The normal hip contains only a small amount of ﬂuid in the anterior joint recess. (Image 24.6, 24.7) The physiologic ﬂuid in the normal hip joint creates a stripe sign be- tween the anterior and posterior reﬂection of the joint capsule. Pres- ence of the stripe sign excludes pathologic effusion. 1 (Image 24.8) 224 IMAGE 24.6 - Normal hip joint IMAGE 24.7 - Normal hip joint The normal anterior joint capsule appears concave, whereas an effu- sion creates a distention of the capsule, resulting in a convex appear- ance. (Hip effusion) Measurement from the cortex of the femoral neck to the outer capsule is less than 7mm in a normal joint, with less than 1-2mm difference between the affected and unaffected sides.2-6 (Image 5.9) 225 IMAGE 24.8 - Normal hip with stripe sign IMAGE 24.9 - Normal hip with joint capsule <7mm SUMMARY: From lateral to medial you should identify: Femoral nerve Femoral artery Femoral vein Use color ﬂow and compressibility to differentiate the structures SECTION 3 Nerves and Vasculature The femoral neurovascular bundle lies medial and superﬁcial to the femoral head. The femoral nerve is the most lateral structure, with the femoral artery and vein being more medial. The femoral nerve has a hypoechoic hone y c omb a p- pe ar an ce wh e n viewed in trans- verse. Color ﬂow can be used to bet- ter dif ferentiate vascular structures. (Ima g e 2 4.1 0, 24 . 11 , M o v i e 24.2) The vein will be compressible, while the artery w i l l n o t .

The iliopsoas bursa lies between the anterior joint capsule and the iliopsoas tendon and will not be visible in normal states. 7 (Image 24.12) 228 IMAGE 24.12 The sartorius and the tensor fasciae latae can be visualized superﬁ- cial to the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) (Image 24.13, 24.14). The rectus femoris can be visualized from its origin on the anterior inferior iliac spine and followed distally between the tensor fasciae latae and the sartorius. (Image 24.15,24.16) 229 IMAGE 24.13 IMAGE 24.14 IMAGE 24.15 IMAGE 24.16 LATERAL: The lateral hip, and region surrounding the greater trochanter, can be evaluated by placing the transducer over the superior femur in a transverse plane and by moving the transducer posteriorly and later- ally. (Movie 24.4) Having the patient lie on the opposite hip will make this region easier to visualize.7 Move the transducer to a coronal-oblique plane, (Image 24.17) and identify the greater tro- chanter with the gluteus maximus overlying the trochanteric bursa. (Image 24.18) The iliotibial track can be seen superﬁcially and later- ally as a hyperechoic structure overlying the gluteus medius. (Image 24.19) Transverse images over the greater trochanter show the glu- teus medius tendon laterally, with the gluteus maximus posterior and superﬁcial to a portion of the gluteus medius tendon. (Image 24.20) The bursa surrounding the greater trochanter will not be visualized in most asym p t omatic patients. 7 230 MOVIE 24.4 IMAGE 24.17 IMAGE 24.18 POSTERIOR: Place the patient in the prone position and start with the ultrasound probe over the ischial tuberosity.

An effu- sion appears as a dark, hypoechoic ﬂuid collection lifting the ante- rior joint capsule off the femoral head and neck (Hip effusion). Plac- ing the leg in abduction and ﬂexion may help to enhance small ef fus ions . 6 (Ima g e 24.23) A dis- ta n c e o f greater than 5mm between the femoral n e c k a n d outer capsule in a c hild, and greater than 7mm in an adult has been used as diag- nostic criteria for a hip ef fusion.1-3,7,8 (Image 24.24) 232 IMAGE 24.23 IMAGE 24.24 Compare to the asymptomatic side for asymmetry, with greater than 1.46-2 mm of difference in children and 1mm in adults being concern- ing for effusion, respectively. 4,7,9,10 Use a transverse-oblique view to examine the femoral head and anterior recess of the joint in cross section. (Image 24.25) Hip effusions can appear as hypoechoic, hyperechoic or mixed echogenicity.11 (Complex hip effusion). Ultrasound characteristics of a hip effusion lack the sensitivity and speciﬁcity to distinguish a septic from an aseptic process. 5,6 When suspicion of a septic process is high, arthrocentesis should be performed. Dislocation of the hip joint can be conﬁrmed by ultrasound of the hip anteriorly.(24.26) 233 IMAGE 24.25 IMAGE 24.26 A loss of the normal alignment between the femoral head and ace- tabulum conﬁrms dislocation. 12 Reduction can be conﬁrmed using a similar view. (Image 24.27, Movie 24.5,Image 24.28, Movie 24.6) 234 IMAGE 24.27 - Normal hip MOVIE 24.5 - Normal hip articulation IMAGE 24.28 - Dislocated hip MOVIE 24.6 - Dislocated hip Placing the probe so that it is bridging between the pubic bones can image the pubic symphysis. (Image 24.29) Ultrasound can detect widening of the pubic symphysis in a trauma patient, indicating an open book pelvic fracture. 13 The normal pubic symphysis measures less than 2.5 cm in width. 13 The bursa surrounding the hip can be evaluated for abnormalities by ultrasound. (Image 24.30) Bursitis is suggested by distention of the bursa, pain with transducer pressure, and hyperemia with color or power Doppler. 14,15 There may be ﬂuid in normal bursae and the presence of ﬂuid alone cannot diagnose an inﬂammatory bursitis.2 When evaluating greater trochanteric pain, there is a high degree of correlation between ultrasound, MRI and surgical ﬁndings. 16 (Tro- chanteric bursitis) The iliopsoas bursae is located on top of the iliop- soas tendon and anterior to the hip joint. (Iliopsoas bursitis) Iliop- soas bursitis can be evaluated initially with ultrasound; however, MRI is superior in accuracy when compared to surgical ﬁndings. It is also 235 IMAGE 24.29 IMAGE 24.30 superior for evaluating communication with the hip joint, which can occur in 15% of patients. 17,18 Inguinal lymphadenopathy may be encountered when imaging me- dial to the anterior hip, surrounding the femoral neurovascular bun- dle. Lymph nodes appear as a hyperechoic hilum with a surrounding hypoechoic cortex, with blood ﬂow visible on color ﬂow imaging. 11 Normal lymph nodes measure less than 15mm. Enlarged nodes or nodes with an abnormal pattern of vascular ﬂow may be benign or malignant, but require additional evaluation and possible biopsy. 19,20 (Enlarged lymph nodes) Transient synovitis is characterized by pain and decreased range of motion, presenting without trauma in children with hip pain.21,22 The ultrasound ﬁndings of transient synovitis include intracapsular effu- sion and increased distance between the anterior joint capsule and the femoral neck 2mm greater than the unaffected side. 1,4,5 (Tran- sient synovitis) Once an effusion is diagnosed, ultrasound lacks sensi- tivity to differentiate transient synovitis from septic arthritis, and fur- ther diagnostic testing, including possible arthrocentesis, is required. 21,22-28 236 SECTION 6 Limitations Ultrasound exam of the hip is limited by the deep location of some structures, making a thorough exam in patients with a larger body habitus difﬁcult. The use of ultrasound for femoral fractures and labral pathology is limited, as only a partial view of the joint can be obtained in the best of circumstances. As in other joints, the ultra- sound characteristics of a hip effusion lack the sensitivity to differenti- ate an infectious from inﬂammatory process. Tell everyone that you ﬁnished another chapter!

Ultrasound can assess space between bones such as in the AC and SC joints. SECTION 1 Bones The shoulder is a complex joint that gives up a fair amount of strength for the trade off of mobility. This leads to injury not infre- quently. However, the superﬁciality of the structures involved lends it nicely to sonography of these injuries. (3-D shoulder anatomy anima- tion) The main structures to be examined via ultrasound include the bones, muscles, tendons, and bursa. (Video tutorial of rotator cuff anatomy) HUMERAL HEAD: \t The humeral head can be assessed via sonography for superﬁ- cial fracture and dislocation (Image 25.1). There are limitations, as fractures within the joint may be missed, but humeral neck fractures and superﬁcial humeral head fractures can be diagnosed relatively consistently. (Humeral fracture on ultrasound missed by x-ray) 241 IMAGE 25.1 Greater tuberosity fractures, which sometimes are missed on x-ray, can be identiﬁed on ultrasound as a cortical stepoff. (greater tuberos- ity fracture).1 DISLOCATION:     Shoulder dislocation can be readily assessed via ultrasound from mul- tiple approaches. From the posterior approach, the probe is slid up the lateral portion of the humerus until the head is in view just infe- rior to the acromion. At this point, the probe is slid posterior to ob- tain a view of the humeral head, labrum, and glenoid. With this view, the anterior-posterior distance of the humerus from the glenoid rim can be measured. A normal shoulder will have the humeral head approximately .5-1cm posterior to the glenoid. How- ever, the best way to assess what is normal for your patient is to scan the unaffected side ﬁrst and use that distance as normal. If the hu- meral head is quite a bit more posterior on the affected side, then consider posterior dislocation. If the humerus is anterior to the gle- noid, then this represents an anterior dislocation, the more common of the two. (Case report with ultrasound image) When this anterior dislocation is identiﬁed, this is a good view in which to perform an ultrasound-guided injection of anesthetic into the joint. (Video demonstration) This can frequently allow reduction of the shoulder without sedation and has the beneﬁt of avoiding complications related to sedation.2,3,4 Although there exists the possibility of joint infection, a recent review found no reported cases of this. 5 Dynamic ultrasound evaluation also allows real time feedback of the position of the humeral head while attempting reduction. Frequently you will not feel the clunk that is normally associated with reduction, which makes this real-time ultrasound feedback very valuable. At least one series has shown bedside ultrasound to be accurate in determining whether reduction has been successful (Ultrasound before and after reduction). 6 Shoul- 242 MOVIE 25.1 One Minute Ultrasound Demonstration of Dislo- cation Evaluation der dislocation can also be assessed from the anterior view by visual- izing the relationship of the coracoid to the humeral head. CLAVICLE: \t The clavicle is a superﬁcial bone that is easily evaluated with ultrasound for fracture or dislocation (Clavicle fractures). The distance between the acromioclavicular (AC) joint and sterno- clavicular (SC) joint can also be assessed with ultrasound for separa- tion and dislocation. These can be most easily found by simply pal- pating the joint ﬁrst. The normal AC joint is approximately 1-3mm, with >6mm being pathologic for adults. 7,8,9 (AC joint evaluation) The more important distance is the difference between affected and unaffected sides, which should be no more than 2-3mm.10,11 The nor- 243 Clavicle Short Axis GALLERY 25.2 AC GALLERY 25.1 - Normal AC mal coracoclavicular distance is 11-12mm. 11 The right and left should be <5mm different. (Acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular anat- omy) Other pathologic processes of the AC joint include osteoar- throsis, cysts, and infections. 12 244 SUMMARY Tendon tears usually appear hypoechoic Evaluation of the various tendons include: Supraspinatus Infraspinatus/Teres Minor Subscapularis Biceps Tendon SECTION 2 Muscles/Tendons The rotator cuff may seem like an intimidating structure when taken as a whole, but the component parts can each be assessed via sonography with relative ease. (rotator cuff anatomy video) SUPRASPINATUS: The supraspinatus is located just inferior to the acromion, coming out from under it laterally to attach on the greater tuberosity. In order to ultrasound a larger por- tion of it, the patient is positioned with the back of the hand against the o p p o s i t e b a c k poc ket.(Image 25.4, Video 25.2) This maneu- ver, the Crass position, pulls the supraspinatus out from under the acro- mion (Video demonstra- tion of supraspinatus evaluation) 245 IMAGE 25.2 Supraspinatus Coming From Underneath Acromion IMAGE 25.3 Supraspinatus It can then be evaluated in both the long and short axes for tears or tendinosis (supraspinatus tear). A tendon tear will be a hypoechoic or anechoic region within the muscle ﬁbers and can be partial or full thickness. The appearance of a tear and tendinosis can overlap, with both sometimes appearing hypoechoic. Calciﬁc tendinosis will have a discrete area of hyperechoic calcium with shadowing (Calciﬁc tendinosis).In general, a tear is usually more anechoic, homogene- ous, well-deﬁned, and associated with a bony irregularity.13 Tendino- sis, however, will frequently show swelling and heterogeneity, be hy- poechoic instead of anechoic, and have no bony irregularity. If the tendon irregularity is immediately adjacent to a cortical irregularity of the greater tuberosity, then this is highly suggestive of a tear in- stead of tendinosis. 13,14 (Various supraspinatus tears) The supraspinatus tendon is the most commonly torn tendon of the rotator cuff, and care should be taken to evaluate it fully, as tears of- ten occur more anteriorly, near the rotator interval15 (Supraspinatus evaluation with examples of various pathology). You can be sure you are anterior enough when you are able to also visualize the bi- ceps tendon. SUBSCAPULARIS: From the supraspinatus, the ultrasound probe can be moved just infe- rior and slightly medially to visualize the subscapularis (Gallery 25.3) (Subscapularis examination video). 246 IMAGE 25.4 Crass Posi- tion MOVIE 25.2 Crass Manuever GALLERY 25.3 - Subscapularis The subscapularis tendon runs from its medial muscle to attach later- ally at the lesser tuberosity (Subscapularis muscle). The biceps groove, including the greater and lesser tuberosity, as well as the biceps tendon can be used as a landmark. Having the pa- tient rotate the shoulder externally will pull the tendon more laterally and bring it perpendicular to the probe, thus enhancing the image by decreasing anisotropy. This external rotation maneuver will also make a subscapularis tear, which normally occurs at the lesser tube- rosity, more prominent. (Movie) There are usually other pathologies present, as subscapularis tears rarely happen in isolation. 16 (Video case of subscapularis tear) BICEPS TENDON: From the subscapularis view, it is relatively easy to identify the biceps tendon. The subscapularis attaches to the lesser tuberosity, which is the medial border of the biceps groove. (Subscapularis muscle) The biceps tendon is within this groove, just lateral to the lesser tuberos- ity, with the greater tuberosity making up the lateral border of the groove. (Biceps tendon anatomy) By having the patient sit with the palm up on the thigh, the biceps groove is rotated in an anterior orientation that makes it accessible by ultrasound. (Gallery 25.4) 247 GALLERY 25.4 - Biceps tendon MOVIE 25.3 - Subscapularis tear The tendon can be assessed in both the long and short axes in this position. (Video of biceps tendon evaluation) Tendinosis and tears of the biceps tendon can be appreciated on ul- trasound. They have a similar appearance to tears of other tendons discussed. (Biceps tendon rupture images) A full thickness tear will appear as an empty bicipital groove, as the tendon is retracted from the groove. 17 Clinically, the patient may have a Popeye’s Deformity with a complete biceps tendon rupture. Biceps tendon dislocation will also have the appearance of an empty bicipital groove, so it is important to look for the tendon adjacent to the groove to differentiate tear from dislocation.18 (Video case of bi- ceps tendon dislocation) It is also important to tilt the probe back and forth during evaluation of the biceps tendon in the short axis, as anisotropy can give the appearance of an empty groove as well. A joint effusion of the glenohumeral joint is frequently seen as ﬂuid surrounding the biceps tendon due to the fact that the tendon sheath communicates with the glenohumeral joint. If a joint effusion does not move with pressure and has increased blood ﬂow, then it may represent synovitis instead of an effusion.19 Pain with pressure in the area and an effusion that is very localized would suggest synovitis over effusion as well. INFRASPINATUS/TERES MINOR: \t The infraspinatus and teres minor make up the posterior rotator cuff. The patient should be positioned with the arm resting palm up on the thigh. If the probe is placed just inferior to the scapular spine, these muscles and tendons can be viewed just posterior to the gle- noid running distally to attach to the greater tuberosity. (Gallery 25.5) They should be evaluated both in the long axis and short axis. (Video of infraspinatus evaluation) A tear or tendinosis of these tendons will have an appearance simi- lar to a tear of the other tendons. 248 GALLERY 25.5 - Infraspinatus SUMMARY Subacromial-subdeltoid bursa is difﬁcult to see when normal as it is a potential space Shoulder pathology that can be diagnosed with ultrasound: Infraspinatus atrophy Calciﬁc tendinosis Impingement syndrome Adhesive Capsulitis Others SECTION 3 Bursa and Other Pathology BURSA: \t The subacromial-subdeltoid bursa is a bursal sac ﬁlled with ﬂuid that lies beneath the acromion and deltoid as well as above the rota- tor cuff in order to protect the rotator cuff. Its ultrasound appear- ance is subtle, as it is more of a potential space if no pathology is present. However, with pathology such as a rotator cuff tear, bursi- tis, proliferative disorders, amyloidosis, or impingement syndrome, it can become distended and more easily recognizable on ultrasound. (subacromial bursitis) The diagnosis of subacromial bursal ﬂuid (Movie 25.4 and Movie 25.5) is made when the walls of the bursa are separated by more than 1-2mm. 20 Injection of the subacromial bursa is discussed in the Ultrasound Guided Injections chapter. Other Pathology: \t Infraspinatus atrophy is a condition that may result from either a rotator cuff tear with poor biomechanics or a suprascapular nerve impingement.13 It is diagnosed by decreased area, which is nor- mally twice that of the teres minor.21 \t Calciﬁc tendinosis is a process that most commonly affects the supraspinatus. It is usually from degeneration and has a hypere- choic appearance with shadows in the majority of cases. Impingement syndrome is strongly suggested when there is pooling of subacromial bursal ﬂuid during active elevation of the arm at the acromion tip. 22 The most common impingement syndrome is that of the supraspinatus, as it travels underneath the acromion. It is caused by narrowing of this space and leads to tendinosis, occasional tear, and bursal ﬂuid. 13 (Impingement evaluation with ultrasound) 249 Adhesive capsulitis can be thought of as a more severe form of impingement syndrome that manifests sonographically as con- tinuous limitation of the sliding of the supraspinatus under the acromion. 13 This continued limitation of the sliding movement of the supraspinatus tendon against the acromion was found to be 91% sen- sitive and 100% speciﬁc in one study.23 Thickening of the coracohu- meral ligament has also been shown to strongly correlate with adhe- sive capsulitis. 24 Studies have demonstrated many other pathologies of the shoulder that can be diagnosed or treated with ultrasound guidance. These include, but are not limited to, paralabral cysts, labral tears, amyloi- dosis, quadrilateral space syndrome, pectoralis tendon tears, malig- nant lymph nodes, neuromas, elastoﬁbrosis, and bony metastasis. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 As technology improves and we gain more experience, we will undoubtedly ﬁnd other uses for ultrasound to diagnose and treat disease and injury of the shoulder.

Prior to planned joint aspiration the phy- sician should consider diagnostic ultrasound to conﬁrm the clini- cal suspicion of a joint effusion. In one study, the decision to perform arthrocentesis in emergency department patients was changed in 65% of cases by performing pre-procedure ultrasound. 5 SECTION 1 Introduction 254 SUMMARY: Evaluate the joint with ultrasound and mark prior to injection Glenohumeral joint injection accuracy improves from 10-42% without ultrasound to 94% with ultrasound AC joint injection accuracy may increase from 40-45% to close to 100% with ultrasound Injection of the elbow, hip, knee, ankle, and MTP joints can be performed reliably with ultrasound guidance SECTION 2 Technique TECHNIQUE Evaluate the joint of interest with ultrasound prior to attempting the procedure. A surgical skin marker can be used to mark the injection site prior to skin cleaning with chlor- hexidine, iodine, or surgical prep. Place a wheel of local anesthetic over the injection site. Sterile pre- cautions should be in use before at- tempting joint aspiration or injec- tion. A sterile probe cover, sterile gel, drape, and sterile gloves should be employed to minimize the risk of infection. The high fre- quency linear probe is used for the majority of musculoskeletal proce- dures. (Image 26.1 and 26.2) However, the curvilinear probe may be needed for deeper joints, such as the hip, in patients with larger body habitus. (Image 26.3) A 22-gauge spinal needle can be used for deeper injections while a 22 or 18-gauge needle can be used for more superﬁcial structures. SHOULDER The accuracy of glenohumeral joint injec- tion using an anterior landmark technique is between 10-42% as compared with 94% with ultrasound guidance. 5-9 255 IMAGE 26.1 IMAGE 26.2 IMAGE 26.3 The ultrasound guided aspiration or injection of the glenohumeral joint is performed from a posterior lateral approach. Place the high frequency probe parallel to the infraspinatus, just caudal to the spine of the scapula. (Gallery 26.1) Identify the humerus, glenoid and gle- noid labrum. (Gallery 26.1) Adduct the humerus across the thorax, with the patient reaching towards the opposite shoulder. After pre- paring a sterile ﬁeld, insert the needle laterally, in plane with the ul- trasound probe. (Gallery 26.1) Begin with the needle 1-2 cm lateral to the probe to allow for a shallower angle and better needle visuali- zation. Bending the needle 30 degrees can be helpful in following the curvature of the humeral head and improving placement in the joint. 10(Gallery 26.1) Visualize the needle tip pass under the gle- noid labrum and into the joint capsule or effusion. (Glenohumeral joint injection) The acromioclavicular joint, while superﬁcial, can be difﬁcult to accu- rately inject with a blind technique. Injection accu- racy without ultrasound is between 40-45% and in- creases to 100% with ul- trasound in some small studies. 1,11 Plac e t he ultrasound probe over the distal clavicle. Follow the clavicle distally to the junc- tion with the acromion. (Image 26.1) The joint is visualized as an in- terruption of the hyperechoic cortex of both bones with a surround- ing thin joint capsule. (Image 26.4) A small effusion may be com- pressed by over-application of pressure with the ultrasound probe. Position the patient in a seated position with the arm at the side to open the joint space. Due to the superﬁcial location of the acromio- clavicular joint, injec- tion is less compli- cated to perform in sh or t axis, also known as the out of plan e appr o ac h . (Gallery 26.2) Injec- tion or arthrocentesis can be performed in real time with the ul- trasound probe or blindly once the joint has been identiﬁed and marked. Avoid passing the needle through the joint as 256 Parallel to the infraspinatus GALLERY 26.1 IMAGE 26.4 GALLERY 26.2 Short Axis Approach the supraspinatus tendon lies distally and can be damaged by unin- tentional injection. ELBOW The elbow can be injected with ultrasound guidance by a posterior lateral approach. 10,12 Ultrasound is useful to differentiate a joint effu- sion from bursitis and can improve diagnostic accuracy of an effu- sion over clinical exam alone. 13 (Elbow effusions) Position the patient with th e e l b o w b e n t a t 90°and facing away from the physician. (Gal- lery 26.3) Place the lin- ear probe over the poste- rior elbow in long axis with the triceps tendon. Identify the olecranon fossa with the olecranon distal and the humerus proximal. (Image 26.5) With the distal trans- ducer on the olecranon, rotate the proximal transducer 30° lat- erally until the lateral trochlea of the humerus is visualized. (Movies 26.1 and 26.2) After the sterile ﬁeld is pre- pared, the needle can be introduced in plane from proximal to distal passing through the triceps muscle and avoid- ing the triceps tendon.10 (Image 26.6) 257 GALLERY 26.3 Elbow Positions IMAGE 26.5 MOVIE 26.1 MOVIE 26.2 IMAGE 26.6 HIP Intra-articular hip injections can provide diagnostic information as well as symptom relief for osteoarthritis of the hip.14,15 Ultrasound guided aspiration or injection of the hip joint is safe and accurate when compared to ﬂuoroscopy and CT guidance. 16-18 Advantages of ultrasound over ﬂuoroscopy include the ability to visualize soft tissue and vascular structures, portability of the equipment, and a lack of radiation. Ultrasound guided hip aspiration has been described as being performed safely and accurately by emergency physicians in the emergency department setting.19-22 Place the patient in the supine position. The femoral neurovascular bundle is located medially and can be easily identiﬁed with color ﬂow in cross section. (Gallery 26.4) Begin by identifying the femoral neurovascular bundle and move laterally. Find the junction of the femoral head and neck, which is 30° in a coronal oblique plane off the long axis of the femur. (Gallery 26.4) The normal joint capsule overlies the anterior femoral neck. In the presence of effusion, the anterior joint capsule becomes convex and ﬁlled with hypo or hypere- choic ﬂuid. (Case Study) The target for injection or aspiration will be the junction of the femoral head and neck. (Gallery 26.4) Mark the orientation for the probe with a surgical marker and cleanse the site with a surgical prep. Place local anesthetic over the site of needle insertion. Place the probe in line with the femoral neck and visualize the junction between the femoral head and neck. Identify and avoid the circumﬂex femoral vessels using color Doppler. (Movie 26.3) In- sert a 22-gauge spinal needle in plane with the ultrasound probe to- wards the junction of the femoral head and neck. (Gallery 26.4) Set the angle of the needle to avoid the circumﬂex vessels. Once the nee- dle contacts bone, withdraw slightly. Begin injecting slowly. There should be minimal injection pressure felt. If there is more than mini- mal pressure then you are probably not in the joint. Visualize ﬂuid ﬂowing into the joint capsule. (Movie 26.4) (Ultrasound-guided hip injection tutorial) 258 The femoral neurovascular bundle is located medially and can be easily identified with color flow in cross sec- tion. GALLERY 26.4 MOVIE 26.3 MOVIE 26.4 KNEE Ultrasound is useful for injection or aspiration of the knee, especially in patients with difﬁcult anatomy. The use of ultrasound has been shown to improve accuracy of injections over a landmark-based technique.1, 23 When compared with a blind technique for knee arthrocentesis, ultrasound did not change the amount of ﬂuid ob- tained, but did decrease patient pain and the time required to per- form the procedure. It also made the procedure easier to perform when r at ed b y t he provider. 24 Begin by scan- ning the knee for presence of an effusion.(Figure 26.1) With the knee in full exten- sion, image the suprapatellar recess and lateral pouches. (Image 26.7) A joint effu- sion is visible in the suprapa- tellar view deep to the quad- ri c e p s t e n d o n . (Knee joint effusion) Turn the probe 90° to a transverse view with the probe abutting the proximal edge of the patella. (Gallery 26.5) After sterile preparation, insert the needle from the lateral side of the knee in plane with the ultrasound probe. Insert the needle in the soft spot between the iliotibial band and the vastus lateralis tendon. (Gal- lery 26.6) The injection should ﬂow easily into the joint space without a ﬂuid collection being visualized in the soft tissues. The anterior lat- eral or anterior medial approach can also be used with the ultra- sound probe bridging between the patella and the femur. 25 (Gallery 26.6) If available, a small footprint high frequency probe should be employed. (Gallery 26.6 and Movie 26.5) (Ultrasound-guided knee injection tutorial) 259 FIGURE 26.1 IMAGE 26.7 GALLERY 26.5 ANKLE The use of ultrasound improves accuracy over blind techniques for ankle injections. 26 The procedure is well described in the radiology literature and in case reports from emergency medicine.25, 27 Ultrasound offers the beneﬁt of being able to detect small effusions that are not visible by radiog- raphy. 28 With the ankle plantar ﬂexed, identify the dorsalis pedis artery using palpation or color Doppler. The deep peroneal nerve sits lateral to the artery. Place the ultrasound probe in a long axis with the tibia, between the lateral malleolus and the extensor digitorum longus. The joint space will be visible between the tibia and the talus. After ster- ile preparation, insert the needle in plane from distal to proximal. Al- ternatively, an approach with the needle in short axis with the probe can be use d. (Gallery 26.7) 260 Insert the needle in the soft spot between the iliotibial band and the vastus lateralis tendon. GALLERY 26.6 MOVIE 26.5 With the ankle plantar flexed, identify the dorsalis pedis artery using palpation or color Doppler. GALLERY 26.7 METATARSOPHALANGEAL JOINT The metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint is easily evaluated by ultrasound.(Image 26.8) An asymptomatic patient can have an effu- sion on ultrasound, making clinical correlation with history and exam especially important. Place the high frequency linear probe over the MTP joint in long axis. (Gallery 26.8) Identify the joint space between the metacarpal and the proximal phalange. Avoid over compression with the ultra- sound probe, as that could obscure a small effusion. Mark the joint space and prep the area. Due to the superﬁcial location of the MTP, an out of plane approach with the needle is preferred. With the MTP ﬂexed and distracted, cen- ter the joint space in the mid- dle of the ultrasound probe and insert the needle from the medial side out of plane with the ultrasound. Insert the needle below the exten- sor tendon. (Movie 26.6) Alternatively, ultrasound can also be used to identify and mark the joint space to guide a blind injection or 261 Place the high frequency linear probe over the MTP joint in long axis. GALLERY 26.8 MOVIE 26.6 IMAGE 26.8 aspiration. CONCLUSION While ultrasound is not necessary for all injections or aspirations it is a very useful medium indeed. It has been shown to decrease complications, decrease pain, and improve success in multiple studies for multiple joints. Tell ever yone that you ﬁnished another chapter!
