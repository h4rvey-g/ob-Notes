This is the reason angled 60 degrees in the frontal plane, which means why P waves can appear biphasic in V1. However, the negative that the atrial vector in the frontal plane is always deflection only appears if that vector is detected by V1, which directed towards lead Il, provided that the impulse is not always the case. Meanwhile, V5 detects a depolarization originates in the sinoatrial node. Consequently, the travelling more or less towards it throughout, and this yields P wave is always positive in lead Il during sinus rhythm. a positive P wave. The P wave is, however, most often also positive in leads aVL, -aVR, aVF, |, V4, V5 and V6.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":"eng"}
