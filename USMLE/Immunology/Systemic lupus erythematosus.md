# Epidemiology

# Etiology
- Genetic predisposition
	- HLA-DR2 and HLA-DR3 are commonly present in individuals with SLE.
	- Genetic deficiency of classical pathway complement proteins (C1q, C2, C4) in approx. 10% of affected individuals
- Hormonal factors: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hyperestrogenic states (e.g., due to oral contraceptive use, postmenopausal hormonal therapy</span>, endometriosis) are associated with an increased risk of SLE.
- Environmental factors
	- Cigarette smoking and silica exposure increase the risk of developing SLE.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">UV light and EBV infection may trigger disease flares</span>, but there is insufficient evidence on whether they cause SLE.
	- Drugs such as procainamide or hydralazine (see “[[Drug-induced lupus erythematosus]]”)

# Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Autoantibody development: deficiency of classical complement proteins (C1q, C4, C2) → failure of macrophages to phagocytose immune complexes and apoptotic cell material (i.e., plasma and nuclear antigens) → dysregulated, intolerant lymphocytes targeting normally hidden intracellular antigens → autoantibody production (e.g., ANA, anti-dsDNA) </span>
	- Normally, apoptotic cells are engulfed by macrophages during apoptosis, avoiding the release of intracellular content that induces inflammation or an immune response in the extracellular environment.
- Autoimmune reactions
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Type III hypersensitivity (most common in SLE) → antibody-antigen complex formation in microvasculature → complement activation and inflammation → damage to skin, kidneys, joints, small vessels</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Type II hypersensitivity → IgG and IgM antibodies directed against antigens on cells (e.g., red blood cells) → cytopenia</span>

# Clinical features
- SLE is a systemic disease characterized by phases of remission and relapse.
- SLE can affect any organ.
## Common
- Constitutional: fatigue, fever, weight loss
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Joints (> 90% of cases)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Arthritis and arthralgia</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Distal symmetrical polyarthritis: most commonly affects the joints of the fingers, carpal joints, and the knee</span>
- Skin (85% of cases)
	- Malar rash (butterfly rash): flat or raised fixed erythema over both malar eminences (nasolabial folds tend to be spared) 
	- Raynaud phenomenon
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Photosensitivity → maculopapular rash </span>![[Pasted image 20231212100519.png]]
	- Discoid rash  
	- Oral ulcers (usually painless)
	- Nonscarring alopecia (except with discoid rashes)
	- Periungual telangiectasia

# Diagnostics
## Skin biopsy
- Lupus band test (LBT): a direct immunofluorescence staining technique used to detect immunoglobulin and complement component deposits along the dermoepidermal junction in affected and unaffected skin in patients with SLE![[Pasted image 20231029092317.png]]
