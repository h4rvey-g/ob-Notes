Compared to type I-III hypersensitivity reactions, which are antibody-mediated, type IV reactions are mediated by T cells. Type IV hypersensitivity reactions involve two major steps:
1. T cell sensitization: skin penetration by the antigen → uptake of the antigen by Langerhans cell → migration to lymph nodes → formation of sensitized T lymphocytes
2. Presensitized T cell response (after repeated contact with the antigen)
	- CD4+ T cells recognize antigens on antigen-presenting cells → release of inflammatory lymphokines cytokines (e.g., IFNγ, TNF α) → macrophages activation → phagocytosis of target cells 
	- CD8+ T cells recognize antigens on somatic cells → cell-mediated cytotoxicity → direct cell destruction
