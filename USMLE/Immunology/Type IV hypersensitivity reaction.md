Compared to type I-III hypersensitivity reactions, which are antibody-mediated, type IV reactions are mediated by T cells. Type IV hypersensitivity reactions involve two major steps:
1. T cell sensitization: skin penetration by the antigen → uptake of the antigen by Langerhans cell → migration to lymph nodes → formation of sensitized T lymphocytes
2. Presensitized T cell response (after repeated contact with the antigen)
	- CD4+ T cells recognize antigens on antigen-presenting cells → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">release of inflammatory lymphokines cytokines (e.g., IFN-γ, TNF-α)</span> → macrophages activation → phagocytosis of target cells ![[Pasted image 20231217105956.png]]
	- CD8+ T cells recognize antigens on somatic cells → cell-mediated cytotoxicity → direct cell destruction

# Examples
- Skin tests
	- Candida skin test (to test the immune function of T cells)
	- Mantoux tuberculin skin test for latent tuberculosis
