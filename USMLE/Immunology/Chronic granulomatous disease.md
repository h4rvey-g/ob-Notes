Definition: deficiency of superoxide production by polymorphonuclear neutrophils and macrophages
# Etiology
X-linked recessive or autosomal recessive inheritance (2:1)

---
# Pathophysiology
Defective phagocytic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase that results in:
- Decreased respiratory burst in neutrophils

---
# Clinical features
- Recurrent, severe infections (chronic skin, lymph node, bone, respiratory, GI, and urinary tract infections) with <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">catalase-positive organisms</mark> (S. aureus, Nocardia spp., Escherichia coli, Candida, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Aspergillus, Serratia)
- Lymphadenopathy
- Granulomas of the skin and GI/GU tract

---
# Diagnostics
- Neutrophil assay
	- Dihydrorhodamine test (DHR): flow cytometry test showing abnormal NADPH oxidase activity (inability to metabolize dihydrorhodamine to fluorescent product, rhodamine → decreased green fluorescence)
 - Nitroblue tetrazolium dye reduction test: negative

---
# Treatment
- Life-long prophylactic antibiotics, e.g., TMP-SMX (for catalase-positive infections)
- IFN-γ therapy
- Bone marrow transplant
