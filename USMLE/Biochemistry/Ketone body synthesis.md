- Liver cells lack β ketoacyl-CoA transferase → cannot use ketone bodies as fuel.
- Regulation:
	- In prolonged fasting and diabetic ketoacidosis
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Oxaloacetate is depleted for gluconeogenesis.</span>
		- This results in a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">buildup of acetyl-CoA molecules → shunts the pathway toward the production of ketone bodies.</span>
	- In alcoholism
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Excess NADH shunts oxaloacetate to malate.</span>
		- This results in a buildup of acetyl-CoA molecules → shunts the pathway toward the production of ketone bodies.
