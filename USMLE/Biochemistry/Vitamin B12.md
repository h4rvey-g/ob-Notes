# Functions
- Cofactor for enzymes:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Methionine synthase: Methylcobalamin is required for the transfer of methyl groups (e.g., in DNA synthesis).</span>![[Pasted image 20231225210715.png]]
	- Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (e.g., in odd-chain fatty acid metabolism)![[Pasted image 20231225210648.png]]

# Epidemiology

# Etiology
- [[Malabsorption]]
	- ↓ Intrinsic factor (IF)
		- Atrophic gastritis due to
			- Autoimmune atrophic gastritis: most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency
			- H. pylori infection
		- Gastrectomy [1]
	- Reduced uptake of IF-vitamin B12 complex in terminal ileum due to:
		- Alcohol use disorder
		- [[Crohn disease]], [[celiac disease]]
		- Pancreatic insufficiency
		- Surgical resection of the ileum
		- Diphyllobothrium latum (tapeworm) infection
		- Bacterial overgrowth
		- Enteritis
		- Achlorhydria
- Malnutrition
	- [[Anorexia nervosa]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Strict vegan diets: occurs only after years of a strict diet that excludes all animal products (unlike folate deficiency, which occurs within a few months of insufficient intake)</span>
		- Found almost exclusively in animal products (except yeast extract)
- Increased demand: e.g., during pregnancy, breastfeeding, fish tapeworm (Diphyllobothrium latum) infection, and leukemia [1]
- Drugs: metformin

# Pathophysiology
- Dysfunctional methionine synthase (normally converts homocysteine to methionine, thereby demethylating N5-methyl-THF to THF) 
	- ↓ Tetrahydrofolate (THF; cofactor in purine synthesis) → ↓ DNA synthesis → large, nucleated hematopoietic cells, including megaloblasts  → megaloblastic precursors undergo apoptosis or are phagocytosed by macrophages → pancytopenia (including megaloblastic anemia)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Methionine → neuropathy</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Homocysteine</span> → endothelial damage → predisposes to cardiovascular disease
	- Can also cause secondary folate deficiency
- Dysfunctional methylmalonyl CoA mutase
	- Methylmalonyl CoA cannot be converted to succinyl CoA → accumulation of methylmalonyl CoA and its precursor propionyl CoA, as well as their associated odd-chain fatty acids, which cannot be completely metabolized
	- Propionyl CoA replaces acetyl CoA in neuronal membranes → demyelination → neurological manifestations

# Clinical features
- Signs of anemia (e.g., fatigue, pallor) [3]
- Neurological disturbances are generally symmetrical
	- Peripheral neuropathy: tingling, numbness, pins-and-needles sensation, coldness (especially in the lower extremities)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord: symmetrical demyelination of the spinal cord tracts occurs in vitamin B12 deficiency due to insufficient vitamin B12-dependent fatty acid synthesis and production/maintenance of myelin</span>
		- It manifests with the following symptoms:
			- Paresthesia, impaired proprioception, loss of vibratory sensation, tactile sensation, and position discrimination due to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">demyelination of the dorsal columns</span>
			- Spastic paresis due to demyelination of the lateral corticospinal tracts (axons of upper motor neurons)
			- [[Gait]] abnormalities (spinal ataxia) resulting from the damage of spinocerebellar tracts and dorsal columns
		- Long-term deficiency can lead to irreversible neurological damage.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Neuropsychiatric disease</span> (e.g.,<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> reversible dementia</span>, depression, paranoia)
	- Worsening vision 
	- Autonomic dysfunction: impotence and incontinence
- Glossitis

>[!tip] 
>Always consider vitamin B12 deficiency when evaluating patients with dementia.

# Diagnostics
- If vitamin B12 serum levels are normal:
	- Measure homocysteine: elevated in both vitamin B12 deficiency and folate deficiency
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Measure methylmalonic acid (MMA) to help rule out folate deficiency (MMA is normal in folate deficiency and elevated in vitamin B12 deficiency )</span>
		- Without vitamin B12, methylmalonyl CoA mutase cannot break down methylmalonyl CoA, which leads to the accumulation of MMA.![[Pasted image 20231225210648.png]]
