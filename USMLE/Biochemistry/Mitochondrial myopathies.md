Definition: A group of disorders characterized by an <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impaired energy production that mainly affects organs with a high energy requirement (e.g., brain).</span>
# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
Caused by defects in mitochondrial DNA, which are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">maternally inherited</span>

---
# Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Impaired oxidative phosphorylation → decreased production of energy in mitochondria (lack of ATP) → up-regulation of [[glycolysis]] → overproduction of pyruvate → accumulation of lactate and alanine </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Organs with a high energy requirement (e.g., retina, brain, inner ear, skeletal, cardiac muscles) are particularly affected.</span>

---
# Clinical features
- Commonly external ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and/or exertional muscle weakness.

---
# Diagnostics
- Genetic studies (including mitochondrial DNA)
- Muscle biopsy: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Immunohistochemistry typically shows ragged red fibers, which are caused by subsarcolemmal and intermyofibrillar accumulation of defective mitochondria in muscles (mitochondria stain red).</span> ![[Pasted image 20231114165141.png]]
- Laboratory studies
	- Normal CK 
	- Elevated lactate and alanine in serum, urine and/or CSF -- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">lactic acidosis</span>
