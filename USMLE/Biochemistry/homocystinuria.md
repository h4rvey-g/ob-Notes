Definition: a group of inherited genetic disorders characterized by impaired homocysteine metabolism![[Pasted image 20231111104739.png]]
# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Cause deficiencies in one or more of the following enzymes
	- Methionine synthase
	- Cystathionine synthase: an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine and serine to cystathionine, using [[vitamin B6]] as a cofactor.
	- Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR): an enzyme involved in folate metabolism that reduces N5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to methyltetrahydrofolate.
- Impaired affinity of cystathionine synthase for pyridoxal phosphate
