Definition: a group of inherited genetic disorders characterized by impaired homocysteine metabolism![[Pasted image 20231111104739.png]]
# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Autosomal recessive
- Cause deficiencies in one or more of the following enzymes
	- Methionine synthase
	- Cystathionine synthase: an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine and serine to cystathionine, using [[vitamin B6]] as a cofactor.
	- Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR): an enzyme involved in folate metabolism that reduces N5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to methyltetrahydrofolate.
- Impaired affinity of cystathionine synthase for pyridoxal phosphate

---
# Pathophysiology
- Methionine synthase (homocysteine methyltransferase) deficiency → impaired conversion of homocysteine into methionine
- Cystathionine synthase deficiency → impaired conversion of homocysteine into cystathionine
- All forms result in the accumulation of homocysteine.

# Clinical features
- Nonspecific features in infancy: growth faltering, developmental delay
- Eyes
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Downward and inward subluxation of the ocular lens (ectopia lentis) after 3 years of age (in Marfan syndrome, the lens usually luxates upwards and outwards)</span>![[Pasted image 20231111110428.png]]
	- Myopia and glaucoma later in life
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Progressive intellectual disability</span>
- Psychiatric and behavioral disorders
- Light skin
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Marfanoid features]]</span>
	- Tall, thin
	- Pectus deformities (e.g., pectus excavatum)
	- Scoliosis
	- Elongated limbs (↑ arm:height ratio; ↓ upper:lower body segment ratio), arachnodactyly
	- Hyperlaxity of joints and hyperelasticity of the skin
 
>[!tip] 
>Marfan syndrome and homocystinuria both present with marfanoid habitus. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Distinguishing features include intellectual disability, which is only seen in homocystinuria, and the direction of lens dislocation (downwards in homocystinuria and upwards in Marfan syndrome).</span>
- Osteoporosis
- Cardiovascular complications like thromboembolism, premature arteriosclerosis, and coronary heart disease increase the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke

---
# Diagnostics
- ↑ Homocysteine in urine and serum
- Urine sodium nitroprusside test: Urine changes color to an intense red in the presence of homocysteine.
- Serum methionine levels
	- Increased in cystathionine synthase deficiency
	- Decreased in methionine synthase deficiency and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency

---
# Treatment
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Some patients respond to large doses of [[Vitamin B6|pyridoxine]] ([[vitamin B6]]).</span>
- Methionine synthase deficiency: high-methionine diet
- Cystathionine synthase deficiency
	- Low-methionine, high-cysteine diet
	- Supplementation of vitamin B12 and folate
- Impaired affinity of cystathionine synthase for pyridoxal phosphate: high-cysteine diet
- MTHFR deficiency: supplementation of folate
