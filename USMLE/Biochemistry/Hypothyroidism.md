# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Primary hypothyroidism: insufficient thyroid hormone production</span>
	- [[Hashimoto thyroiditis]]
		- The most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient regions
		- Associated with HLA-DR3 and other autoimmune diseases (e.g., vitiligo, pernicious anemia, type 1 [[diabetes mellitus]], and [[systemic lupus erythematosus]])
	- Postpartum thyroiditis (subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis) 
	- [[Subacute thyroiditis|De Quervain thyroiditis]] (subacute granulomatous thyroiditis): often subsequent to a flu-like illness
	- Iatrogenic: e.g., post thyroidectomy, radioiodine therapy, antithyroid medication (e.g., amiodarone, lithium)
	- Nutritional (insufficient intake of iodine): the most common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide, particularly in iodine-deficient regions
	- [[Riedel thyroiditis]]: occurs in IgG4-related systemic disease
	- Wolff-Chaikoff effect
	- Thyroid dysplasia: a disorder of embryologic development characterized by abnormal development and/or location of thyroid tissue (e.g., lingual thyroid)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Secondary hypothyroidism: pituitary disorders (e.g., [[pituitary adenoma]]) → TSH deficiency</span>
- Tertiary hypothyroidism: hypothalamic disorders → TRH deficiency

# Congenital hypothyroidism
## Clinical features
- Umbilical hernia
- Prolonged neonatal jaundice
	- Most commonly, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia
		- Primarily due to decreased UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity
- Hypotonia
- Decreased activity, poor feeding, and adipsia 
- Hoarse cry, macroglossia
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cretinism: a complication of severe, untreated congenital hypothyroidism that leads to impaired development of the brain and skeleton, resulting in skeletal abnormalities (e.g., short stature and delayed fontanelle closure) and permanent intellectual disabilities</span>
>[!warning] 
>Most children with congenital hypothyroidism do not have symptoms at the time of birth because the placenta supplies the fetus with maternal thyroid hormone. For this reason, neonatal screening is vital even if children are asymptomatic. Irreversible intellectual disabilities can be avoided through early initiation of adequate therapy!

## Diagnostics
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Neonatal screening to measure TSH levels</span> 24–48 hours after birth is required by law.
- Increased TSH levels indicate congenital hypothyroidism.
