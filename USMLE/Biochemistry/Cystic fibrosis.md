# Etiology
CF is a hereditary autosomal recessive disorder caused by defective <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">CFTR</mark> (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) protein due to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">mutation in the CFTR gene located on the long arm of chromosome 7</span>.

---
# Pathophysiology
- Mutated CFTR gene → misfolded protein → retention for degradation of the defective protein in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) → absence of ATP-gated chloride channel on the cell surface of epithelial cells throughout the body (e.g., intestinal and respiratory epithelia, sweat glands, exocrine pancreas, exocrine glands of reproductive organs)
- In sweat glands
	- Defective ATP-gated chloride channel →<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> inability to reabsorb Cl- from the lumen of the sweat glands → reduced reabsorption of Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>2</sup>O → excessive loss of salt and elevated levels of NaCl in sweat</span>
- In all other exocrine glands (e.g., in the GI tract or lungs)
	- Defective ATP-gated chloride channel → inability to transport intracellular Cl- across the cell membrane → reduced secretion of Cl- and H2O → accumulation of intracellular Cl- → ↑ Na+ reabsorption (via ENaC)  → ↑ H2O reabsorption  →<mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;"> formation of hyperviscous mucus → accumulation of secretions and blockage of small passages of affected organs → chronic inflammation and remodeling </mark>→ organ damage (see “Clinical features” below) 
	- ↑ Na+ reabsorption → transepithelial potential difference between interstitial fluid and the epithelial surface increases (i.e., negative charge increases; e.g., from normal -13 mv to abnormal -25 mv)

# Clinical features
## GI
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Meconium ileus (in newborns)</span>
- Failure to thrive (due to [[malabsorption]])
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pancreatic disease (obstruction of pancreatic ducts)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Autopsy revealed pancreas develops cysts and became scarred, that's how it's named cystic fibrosis</span>
	- Pancreatitis
	- Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Foul-smelling [[steatorrhea]]</span> (fatty stools) may occur.
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Malabsorption]]</span>
		- Abdominal distention 
		- [[Diarrhea]]
		- Hypoproteinemia
		- Deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins
- CF-related [[diabetes mellitus]] (CFRD)
- Liver and bile duct abnormalities
	- Biliary [[cirrhosis]] with portal hypertension, jaundice, and/or esophageal varices
- Intestinal obstruction: abdominal distention, pain, and a palpable mass
- Rectal prolapse (rare)
>[!tip] 
>In almost all cases of meconium ileus, cystic fibrosis is the underlying disease.

## Respiratory
- Chronic obstructive lung disease with [[bronchiectasis]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chronic [[sinusitis]]: nasal polyps may eventually develop </span>
- Recurrent or chronic productive cough and pulmonary infections
	- S. aureus is the most common cause of recurrent pulmonary infection in infancy and childhood.
	- P. aeruginosa is the most common cause of recurrent pulmonary infections in adulthood.
 - Hemoptysis (Recurrent infections lead to increased vulnerability of the lung tissue)
 - Signs of chronic respiratory insufficiency: digital clubbing
## Sweat glands
- Particularly salty sweat
- Possible electrolyte wasting
## Genital
- Men: usually infertile
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Obstructive azoospermia is common, spermatogenesis may be intact</span> 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The vas deferens may be absent. </span>
		- CF causes the vas deferens to atrophy early in embryologic development.
- Women: reduced fertility
	- Thick cervical mucus is harder for the sperm to travel through

# Diagnostics
## Confirmatory tests
- Sweat test (quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis)
	- Indications: preferred initial test in all patients with suspected CF
## Newborn screening
Newborn screening (NBS) for CF is essential for early detection and treatment, which can improve health outcomes. In many countries, including the US, it is mandatory to screen for CF.
- Sample collection: newborn blood spot test, performed via heel prick blood sampling in the first 24 and 48 hours of life
- Screening tests
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT</span>) : initial screening test
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">IRT levels are thought to become elevated due to mucus plugs</span>, which cause pancreatic duct obstruction, preventing the conversion of trypsinogen to trypsin. This can occur in neonates with or without pancreatic insufficiency.
		- An immunofluorescence assay that measures levels of IRT
		- Normal IRT levels: CF unlikely
		- Elevated IRT levels: CF possible; additional screening tests required
	- CFTR mutation testing (DNA testing): second-tier screening test
