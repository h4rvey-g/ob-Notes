# Etiology
CF is a hereditary autosomal recessive disorder caused by defective <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">CFTR</mark> (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) protein due to mutation in the CFTR gene located on the long arm of chromosome 7.

---
# Pathophysiology
- Mutated CFTR gene → misfolded protein → retention for degradation of the defective protein in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) → absence of ATP-gated chloride channel on the cell surface of epithelial cells throughout the body (e.g., intestinal and respiratory epithelia, sweat glands, exocrine pancreas, exocrine glands of reproductive organs)
- In sweat glands
	- Defective ATP-gated chloride channel →<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> inability to reabsorb Cl- from the lumen of the sweat glands → reduced reabsorption of Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>2</sup>O → excessive loss of salt and elevated levels of NaCl in sweat</span>
- In all other exocrine glands (e.g., in the GI tract or lungs)
	- Defective ATP-gated chloride channel → inability to transport intracellular Cl- across the cell membrane → reduced secretion of Cl- and H2O → accumulation of intracellular Cl- → ↑ Na+ reabsorption (via ENaC)  → ↑ H2O reabsorption  →<mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;"> formation of hyperviscous mucus → accumulation of secretions and blockage of small passages of affected organs → chronic inflammation and remodeling </mark>→ organ damage (see “Clinical features” below) 
	- ↑ Na+ reabsorption → transepithelial potential difference between interstitial fluid and the epithelial surface increases (i.e., negative charge increases; e.g., from normal -13 mv to abnormal -25 mv)

# Clinical features
## GI
- Meconium ileus (in newborns)
- Failure to thrive (due to malabsorption)
- Pancreatic disease (obstruction of pancreatic ductsj)
	- Pancreatitis
	- Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency 
	- Foul-smelling steatorrhea (fatty stools) may occur.
	- Malabsorption
	- Abdominal distention 
	- Diarrhea
	- Hypoproteinemia
	- Deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins
- CF-related diabetes mellitus (CFRD)  [12]
- Liver and bile duct abnormalities
	- Biliary cirrhosis with portal hypertension, jaundice, and/or esophageal varices
- Intestinal obstruction: abdominal distention, pain, and a palpable mass
- Rectal prolapse (rare)
>[!tip] 
>In almost all cases of meconium ileus, cystic fibrosis is the underlying disease.

## Respiratory
- Chronic obstructive lung disease with [[bronchiectasis]]
- Chronic sinusitis: nasal polyps may eventually develop 
- Recurrent or chronic productive cough and pulmonary infections
	- S. aureus is the most common cause of recurrent pulmonary infection in infancy and childhood.
	- P. aeruginosa is the most common cause of recurrent pulmonary infections in adulthood.
 - Hemoptysis (Recurrent infections lead to increased vulnerability of the lung tissue)
 - Signs of chronic respiratory insufficiency: digital clubbing
## Sweat glands
- Particularly salty sweat
- Possible electrolyte wasting
## Genital
- Men: usually infertile
	- Obstructive azoospermia is common, spermatogenesis may be intact 
	- The vas deferens may be absent. 
- Women: reduced fertility
	- Thick cervical mucus is harder for the sperm to travel through
