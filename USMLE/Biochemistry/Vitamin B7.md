# Functions
Coenzyme for various carboxylase enzyme complexes, which all add a 1-carbon group
- Fatty acid synthesis: acetyl-CoA carboxylase
	- Acetyl-CoA (2C) → malonyl-CoA (3C)
- [[Gluconeogenesis]]: pyruvate carboxylase
	- Pyruvate (3C) → oxaloacetate (4C)
- Fatty acid reduction: propionyl-CoA carboxylase
	- Propionyl-CoA (3C) → methylmalonyl-CoA (4C)

>[!tip] 
>Biotin is a coenzyme in all carboxylase enzyme complexes that are not [[vitamin K]]-dependent.
