# Functions
Active form: thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)
In thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">a cofactor for several dehydrogenase enzyme reactions</span> (<font color="#ffc000">B</font>e <font color="#ffc000">APT</font>):
- <font color="#ffc000">B</font>ranched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase
- <font color="#ffc000">α</font>-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase ([[TCA cycle]])
- <font color="#ffc000">P</font>yruvate dehydrogenase (links [[glycolysis]] to [[TCA cycle]])
- <font color="#ffc000">T</font>ransketolase ([[HMP shunt]])
# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Heavy drinking
- Malnutrition, [[Metabolic fuel use|starvation]]
- [[Malabsorption]]
- Malignancy

---
# Pathophysiology
- Thiamine deficiency → impaired glucose breakdown → ATP depletion → tissue damage that primarily affects highly aerobic tissues (e.g., brain, heart)
- High-dose glucose infusions lead to increased ATP depletion, which can trigger Wernicke encephalopathy.
	- In malnourished individuals and chronic alcohol users/heavy drinkers, thiamine should be administered before glucose infusions.

# Clinical features
- Beriberi: inadequate thiamine uptake due to malnutrition, heavy drinking, or increased demand (e.g., [[hyperthyroidism]], pregnancy) 
	- Dry beriberi
		- Symmetrical peripheral neuropathy (sensory and motor)
		- Progressive muscle wasting
		- Paralysis
		- Confusion
	- Wet beriberi
		- High-output cardiac failure (due to systemic vasodilation)
		- Dilated cardiomyopathy
		- Cardiomegaly
		- Edema
- Wernicke encephalopathy

>[!tip] 
>In malnourished or alcohol-dependent patients, always administer thiamine before giving dextrose to decrease the risk of precipitating or exacerbating Wernicke encephalopathy.
