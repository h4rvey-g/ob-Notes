- Definition: inherited genetic disorder characterized by impaired [[pyruvate metabolism]]
- Inheritance: X-linked recessive or autosomal recessive
- Pathophysiology
	- Absent pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impaired conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA</span> → reduced production of citrate → impaired citric acid cycle → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">energy deficit (especially in the CNS) → neurological dysfunction</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Excess pyruvate is further metabolized in the Cahill cycle to the following</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lactate via lactate dehydrogenase</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Alanine via alanine aminotransferase</span>
- Clinical features
	- Onset: early neonatal period
	- Poor feeding, lethargy
	- Tachypnea
	- Developmental delay
	- Progressive neurological symptoms (e.g., seizures)
- Diagnostics
	- ↑ Lactate (lactic acidosis) and pyruvate in serum
	- ↑ Alanine in serum and urine
