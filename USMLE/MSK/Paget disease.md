# Epidemiology
- Prevalence: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">second most prevalent skeletal disease after osteoporosis in individuals > 50 years of age</span>

# Pathophysiology
## Overview
Idiopathic disease 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Associated with a high rate of bone remodeling</span>: ↑ RANKL-RANK activity → ↑ NF-κB signaling → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ osteoclast activity → ↑ osteoblast activity → formation of disorganized (woven) bone </span>
	- The result is that newly remodeled bone is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">more vascular, and lacks the strength and shape of normal bone.</span> This weak bone can be <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">easily deformed by stress (e.g., weight bearing) and is highly susceptible to fractures.</span> Furthermore, bone remodeling in Paget disease can result in enlargement of bone, which can result in<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> entrapment neuropathies</span> in regions where nerves pass through bony tunnels (e.g., cranial nerve canals, skull base foramina, spinal canal).
## Stages of Paget disease
Bone remodeling in Paget disease occurs in three phases, followed by a quiescent stage: [2]
- Lytic phase: ↑ number of osteoclasts appear in bone → ↑ osteoclastic activity → ↑ rate of bone resorption 
- Mixed lytic and blastic phase: ↑ osteoclastic activity is accompanied by an ↑ number of osteoblasts, which infiltrate the lacunae  → ↑ rate of bone formation with haphazardly laid collagen fibers  → formation of abnormal hypervascular woven bone 
- Sclerotic phase: Osteoblastic activity overtakes osteoclastic activity, which leads to formation of dense, sclerotic bone.
- Quiescent stage: Both osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity cease (“quiet phase” of the disease).
## Disease localization
The pelvis, skull, vertebral column, and long bones of the lower extremities are the most commonly affected sites.

# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Approximately 70–90% of cases are asymptomatic. </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bone pain</span>, which may be associated with erythema and elevated skin temperature over the affected bones 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Due to increased vascularity of the underlying bone.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pathological fractures: chalk-stick fractures of long bones</span>  [2]
- Bony deformities, e.g., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bowing of legs (saber shin)</span>
- Skull involvement (in ∼ 40% of cases)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Skull enlargement (increasing hat size) </span>
	- Cranial nerve deficits
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Impaired hearing</span>: due to ankylosis of the ossicles  and narrowing of the internal auditory meatus

# Diagnostics
- Serum total [[Alkaline phosphatase|ALP]]: often significantly increased; first-line test to assess disease severity 
- Serum calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels: typically normal
	- Normal homeostasis is usually maintained despite the bone remodeling involved in PDB.
- Bone biopsy
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Typically shows a chaotic, mosaic-like pattern of irregularly juxtaposed lamellar and woven bone</span>![[Pasted image 20231020214727.png]]

# Treatment
## Bisphosphonates
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">First-line therapy for patients with bone pain and those at risk of bone complications</span>  [9]
- Mechanism: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">induce apoptosis of osteoclasts</span>
- Used to treat [[hypercalcemia]] and bone metabolism disorders (e.g., osteoporosis or tumor-induced osteolysis).
- Examples include zoledronic acid, pamidronate, etidronate, and alendronate.
