# Pathophysiology
## Overview
Idiopathic disease 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Associated with a high rate of bone remodeling</span>: ↑ RANKL-RANK activity → ↑ NF-κB signaling → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ osteoclast activity → ↑ osteoblast activity → formation of disorganized (woven) bone </span>
	- The result is that newly remodeled bone is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">more vascular, and lacks the strength and shape of normal bone.</span> This weak bone can be <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">easily deformed by stress (e.g., weight bearing) and is highly susceptible to fractures.</span> Furthermore, bone remodeling in Paget disease can result in enlargement of bone, which can result in<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> entrapment neuropathies</span> in regions where nerves pass through bony tunnels (e.g., cranial nerve canals, skull base foramina, spinal canal).
## Stages of Paget disease
Bone remodeling in Paget disease occurs in three phases, followed by a quiescent stage: [2]
- Lytic phase: ↑ number of osteoclasts appear in bone → ↑ osteoclastic activity → ↑ rate of bone resorption 
- Mixed lytic and blastic phase: ↑ osteoclastic activity is accompanied by an ↑ number of osteoblasts, which infiltrate the lacunae  → ↑ rate of bone formation with haphazardly laid collagen fibers  → formation of abnormal hypervascular woven bone 
- Sclerotic phase: Osteoblastic activity overtakes osteoclastic activity, which leads to formation of dense, sclerotic bone.
- Quiescent stage: Both osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity cease (“quiet phase” of the disease).
## Disease localization
The pelvis, skull, vertebral column, and long bones of the lower extremities are the most commonly affected sites.

# Diagnostics
## [[Arthrocentesis]] and synovial fluid analysis (SFA)
- Polarized light microscopy (with a red filter) appearance of CPP crystals
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Rhomboid-shaped crystals that are weakly positively birefringent</span>
	- Crystals appear blue when their optical axis is oriented parallel to the polarizer.
	- Crystals appear yellow when their axis is perpendicular to the polarizer. 
- Cell count: WBC > 2000/μL with > 50% neutrophils
## Imaging
- X-ray of the affected joint(s)
	- Chondrocalcinosis: calcification of cartilage in the affected joints
