- Definition: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">skin lesions caused by high fibroblast proliferation and collagen production as excessive tissue response to, typically small, skin injuries</span>
- Etiology: imbalance in wound healing processes due to local factors and genetics
- Pathophysiology
	- Increased synthesis and unorganized deposition of collagen type I and collagen type III
	- Increased TGF-Î² expression and fibroblast proliferation
- Clinical features
	- Brownish-red scar tissue of varying consistency (soft or hard) with claw-like appearance that grows beyond the boundaries of the original lesion 
	- Pruritus
	- Pain
	- Localization: earlobes, face (especially cheeks), upper extremities, chest, and neck 
- Diagnosis: based on clinical appearance of lesion and patient history of trauma or surgery
- Treatment: same as for hypertrophic scars (see above) 
- Prognosis
	- Does not regress spontaneously
	- Frequent recurrences after resection
