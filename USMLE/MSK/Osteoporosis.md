# Etiology
## Primary osteoporosis (most common)
- Type I (postmenopausal osteoporosis): postmenopausal women [2][3]
	- Estrogen stimulates osteoblasts and inhibits osteoclasts.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The decreased estrogen levels following menopause lead to increased bone resorption.</span>
- Type II (senile osteoporosis): gradual loss of bone mass as patients age (especially > 70 years)
## Secondary osteoporosis
- Most commonly due to systemic <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">long-term therapy with corticosteroids</span> (e.g., in patients with autoimmune disease)
- Endocrine/metabolic: hypercortisolism, hypogonadism, hyperthyroidism, [[hyperparathyroidism]], renal disease
## Additional risk factors
- Cigarette smoking
- Immobilization or inadequate physical activity
- Malabsorption (e.g., [[celiac disease]]), malnutrition (e.g., diet low in calcium and vitamin D), anorexia
