# Epidemiology

# Etiology
- Idiopathic inflammatory autoimmune disorder of unknown etiology
- Risk factors include:
	- Genetic disposition: associated with HLA-DR4 and HLA-DR1
	- Environmental factors (e.g., smoking)
	- Hormonal factors (premenopausal women are at the highest risk, suggesting a predisposing role of female sex hormones)

---
# Pathophysiology
- Bouts of inflammation, angiogenesis, and proliferation → proliferative granulation tissue with mononuclear inflammatory cells → pannus and synovial hypertrophy → invasion, progressive destruction, and deterioration of cartilage and bone
- Antibodies against Fc portion of IgG (rheumatoid factor, RF) are produced to aid in removing autoantibodies and immune complexes.
	- RF excess triggers formation of new immune complexes and type III HSR
	- Individuals with positive RF are more likely to develop extraarticular manifestations.

# Treatment
## Acute antiinflammatory treatment
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Glucocorticoids</span>
	- Systemic prednisone
		- Longer-term therapy: Only use in patients with highly active RA
- NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors: relieve symptoms, but do not improve the prognosis
## Long-term pharmacological treatment
### Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Methotrexate (MTX): first-line treatment in patients with moderate to high disease activity</span>
	- To minimize adverse effects, administer folic acid.
