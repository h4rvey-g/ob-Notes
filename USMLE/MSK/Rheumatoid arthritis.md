# Epidemiology

# Etiology
- Idiopathic inflammatory autoimmune disorder of unknown etiology
- Risk factors include:
	- Genetic disposition: associated with HLA-DR4 and HLA-DR1
	- Environmental factors (e.g., smoking)
	- Hormonal factors (premenopausal women are at the highest risk, suggesting a predisposing role of female sex hormones)

# Pathophysiology
- Bouts of inflammation, angiogenesis, and proliferation → proliferative granulation tissue with mononuclear inflammatory cells → pannus and synovial hypertrophy → invasion, progressive destruction, and deterioration of cartilage and bone
- Antibodies against Fc portion of IgG (rheumatoid factor, RF) are produced to aid in removing autoantibodies and immune complexes.
	- RF excess triggers formation of new immune complexes and type III HSR
	- Individuals with positive RF are more likely to develop extraarticular manifestations.
