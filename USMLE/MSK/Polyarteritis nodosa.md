# Definition
- Systemic vasculitis of medium-sized vessels and small muscular arteries, leading to tissue ischemia
- Most commonly involves the skin, peripheral nerves, muscles, joints, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys

---
# Epidemiology
- Peak incidence: 45–65 years of age
- Sex: ♂ > ♀

---
# Etiology
- Hepatitis B

---
# Pathophysiology
- Nonspecific symptoms
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fever, weight loss, malaise</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Muscle and joint pain</span>
- Organ involvement
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Renal involvement (∼ 60%): hypertension, renal impairment</span> [2][3]
	- Coronary artery involvement (∼ 35%); <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ risk of myocardial infarction</span>
	- Skin involvement (∼ 40%): rash, ulcerations, nodules
	- Neurological involvement: polyneuropathy (mononeuritis multiplex), <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">stroke</span>
	- GI involvement: abdominal pain, melena, nausea, vomiting
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Usually spares the lungs</span>
		- Helps differentiate PAN from other forms of vasculitis

>[!Mnemonic] 
>In PAN, the Pulmonary Artery is Not involved, PANmural inflammation of the arterial wall is present, and PAN may be associated with hePAtitis B.


>[!tip] 
>PAN should be considered in adults < 65 years of age presenting with stroke or myocardial infarction.

# Clinical features

# Diagnostics
## Visceral angiography
- Findings: most commonly seen in the renal, mesenteric, and hepatic artery branches (pulmonary arteries are usually not affected) 
	- Numerous microaneurysms (1–5 mm in diameter)![[Pasted image 20231010162421.png]]
	- Stenosis of small muscular arteries and medium-sized vessels
