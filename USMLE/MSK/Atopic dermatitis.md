# Epidemiology
- Onset of symptoms usually occurs at 3–6 months of age. 
- Disease often improves with age.

---
# Etiology


---
# Pathophysiology
- Epidermal barrier dysfunction (due to filaggrin deficiency and decreased ceramide levels) → loss of moisture → dry skin
- Inflammation of the skin → severe pruritus

---
# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Main symptoms: intense pruritus and dry skin </span>
- Infantile AD (age < 2 years)
	- Eczema involving the face, head, and extensor surfaces of the extremities that usually spares the diaper area 
	- May present initially with features similar to seborrheic dermatitis, e.g., cradle cap  [9][10][11]
	- **Dennie-Morgan fold**: increased folds below the eye 
		- as a result of eyelid dermatitis![[Pasted image 20230729153839.png]]
	- Occasionally, lesions appear on the trunk. 
- Childhood AD (age 2–12 years) [8]
	- Eczema: <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">flexural creases</mark> (antecubital fossa and popliteal fossa), skin folds, extensor surface of hands 
	- Lesions usually become lichenified (thickening of the skin with accentuated skin markings).
	- ![[Pasted image 20230729155030.png]]
- Adult/adolescent AD (age > 12 years) [7]
	- Lichenified lesions and pruritus of <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">flexor surfaces</mark> of the extremities 
	- Antecubital fossae are frequently involved. 
	- Adult AD may also present as nummular eczema.
- Associated skin findings in AD [8][12][13]
	- Atopic triad: a triad of [[asthma]], allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis that is linked to allergen-triggered IgE-mast cell activation
	- Food allergies
	- Keratosis pilaris: keratinized hair follicles (rough bumps) typically distributed over extensor arms and thighs
	- Hertoghe sign: thinning or loss of the outer third of the eyebrows
 
>[!tip] 
>The symptoms of atopic dermatitis are variable and often change in the course of a lifetime. Pruritus and dry skin are usually the main symptoms.

# Diagnostics
- [[Atopy]]
	- Personal and/or family history
	- Immunoglobulin E reactivity (↑ serum IgE) 
	- Comorbid atopic diseases (i.e., [[asthma]], allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and food allergies)
