- Polymyositis (PM): an inflammatory myopathy <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">affecting the proximal skeletal muscles</span>, with evidence of elevated CK and myositis on EMG and biopsy in the absence of any of the characteristic findings of the other IIM (a rare diagnosis of exclusion)
