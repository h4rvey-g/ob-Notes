# Epidemiology
- Prevalence: most common congenital gastrointestinal tract anomaly

---
# Etiology
- The omphalomesenteric duct (vitelline or vitellointestinal) is a patent tubular structure connecting the yolk sac to the alimentary tract in the embryo.
- The duct is normally obliterated by the 6–7th week of intrauterine life.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Incomplete obliteration of the omphalomesenteric duct → persistence of the proximal (intestinal) segment of the duct → Meckel diverticulum</span>![[Pasted image 20231213092649.png]]![[Pasted image 20231213092707.png]]
- There may be two types of mucosal lining
	- Native ileal mucosa
	- Ectopic mucosa
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common: acid-producing gastric mucosa</span> (∼ 60%)
		- Other types include pancreatic, colonic, and duodenal mucosa.

# Clinical features
## Asymptomatic
- Most common manifestation
- Symptomatic
- Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (most common feature)
	- Presence of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">ectopic gastric mucosa</span> or pancreatic tissue → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">acid or enzyme secretion within the diverticulum → ileal ulceration → bleeding</span>
	- Can manifest as:
		- Hematochezia 
			- Indicates a brisk hemorrhage
		- Tarry stools 
			- Indicate a slow hemorrhage
		- Currant jelly stools
			- Indicate intussusception with bowel ischemia
