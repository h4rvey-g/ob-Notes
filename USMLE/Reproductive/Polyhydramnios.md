# Epidemiology

# Etiology
- Typically idiopathic (âˆ¼ 70% of cases) [18]
- Fetal anomalies
	- Gastrointestinal (e.g., esophageal atresia, duodenal atresia and stenosis): reduced swallowing and absorption of amniotic fluid
	- CNS: anencephaly (leads to impaired swallowing of amniotic fluid, leakage of cerebrospinal fluid, and increased urination due to lack of fetal ADH), meningomyelocele (due to leakage of cerebrospinal fluid) [19]
	- Pulmonary: cystic lung malformations
	- Multiple pregnancy: twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome 
- Maternal conditions
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Diabetes mellitus </span>
		- Increased maternal glucose levels increase fetal glucose levels as well, resulting in polyuria.
	- Rh incompatibility
