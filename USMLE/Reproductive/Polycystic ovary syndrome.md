# Epidemiology
- Prevalence: 6–12% of women in their reproductive years in the US

# Etiology

---
# Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Strong association with obesity → ↑ in peripheral estrogen synthesis from adipose tissue and ↓ in peripheral sensitivity to insulin</span>
	- Estrogen is also produced in other aromatase-containing tissues: Fatty tissue, Placenta
- Reduced insulin sensitivity (peripheral insulin resistance) and the consequent hyperinsulinemia result in:
	- Epidermal hyperplasia and hyperpigmentation ([[acanthosis nigricans]])
	- ↑ Androgen production in ovarian theca interna cells → imbalance between androgen precursors and the resulting estrogen produced in granulosa cells
		- ↑ LH secretion disrupts the LH/FSH balance → impaired follicle maturation with cyst formation due to lack of follicle rupture and anovulation/oligoovulation → infertility
		- ↑ Androgen precursor release and ↑ estrogen production in adipose tissue
	- Inhibition of SHBG in the liver → ↑ free androgens and estrogens
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Unopposed estrogen (lack of progesterone) during anovulatory cycles → endometrial hyperplasia → ↑ risk of endometrial carcinoma</span>

# Clinical features
Onset of symptoms typically occurs during adolescence.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Menstrual irregularities</span>
	- Primary or secondary amenorrhea
	- Oligomenorrhea
	- Menorrhagia
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Infertility or difficulties conceiving</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Insulin resistance and associated conditions</span>
	- Metabolic syndrome (especially obesity) → ↑ risk of sleep apnea
	- [[Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Skin conditions</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hirsutism</span>
		- A condition of excessive male pattern hair growth in women (e.g., on the chin, above the upper lip, and around the umbilicus) that is most commonly idiopathic but associated with excess androgen in 10% of cases.
	- Androgenic [[alopecia]]
	- Acne vulgaris
	- Oily skin
	- [[Acanthosis nigricans]]
- Psychiatric conditions
- Malignancy (increased risk before [[menopause]]): Endometrial cancer
