# Epidemiology
- Prevalence: 6–12% of women in their reproductive years in the US

---
# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Strong association with obesity → ↑ in peripheral estrogen synthesis from adipose tissue and ↓ in peripheral sensitivity to insulin</span>
	- Estrogen is also produced in other aromatase-containing tissues: Fatty tissue, Placenta
- Reduced insulin sensitivity (peripheral insulin resistance) and the consequent hyperinsulinemia result in:
	- Epidermal hyperplasia and hyperpigmentation ([[acanthosis nigricans]])
	- ↑ Androgen production in ovarian theca interna cells → imbalance between androgen precursors and the resulting estrogen produced in granulosa cells
		- ↑ LH secretion disrupts the LH/FSH balance → impaired follicle maturation with cyst formation due to lack of follicle rupture and anovulation/oligoovulation → infertility
		- ↑ Androgen precursor release and ↑ estrogen production in adipose tissue
	- Inhibition of SHBG in the liver → ↑ free androgens and estrogens
		- ↑ Unopposed estrogen (lack of progesterone) during anovulatory cycles → endometrial hyperplasia → ↑ risk of endometrial carcinoma
