# Pathophysiology
## Menstrual irregularities and amenorrhea
- ↓ Ovarian function from age-related ovarian follicle loss leads to:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Estrogen and progesterone levels → loss of negative feedback on the pituitary gland → ↑ GnRH levels → ↑ FSH and LH levels (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism)</span>
	- ↑ In anovulatory cycles 
		- As the ovaries age, they become less responsive to gonadotropin stimulation.
- Ovarian function eventually ceases.
- Iatrogenic removal of the ovaries leads to abrupt cessation of ovarian function.
## Vasomotor symptoms
- Hypothalamic thermoregulatory zone narrows → small temperature changes trigger compensatory reactions
- ↓ Estrogen is associated with ↑ norepinephrine and ↓ serotonin
## Genitourinary symptoms
- Hypoestrogenism → vaginal and vulvar epithelial atrophy, as well as urethral and bladder atrophy
	- Estrogen has positive effects on [[collagen]] and the epithelial surface.

# Clinical features
## Menstrual abnormalities
- Irregular menses that gradually decrease in frequency until complete amenorrhea
## Vasomotor symptoms of menopause (VMS)
- Increased sweating
- Hot flashes
- Heat intolerance
- Seen in ∼ 75% of individuals during perimenopause and menopause
- On average, vasomotor symptoms last for ∼ 7 years.
