# Epidemiology
- Age of onset: adults > 60 years

---
# Etiology
- The primary (idiopathic) form is most common, with age as a major risk factor.
- Secondary forms
	- Joint trauma/damage: including joint surgery, previous juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and [[osteoarthritis]]
	- Metabolic disorders: including hyperparathyroidism, hemochromatosis, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatasia, and possibly gout
	- Familial chondrocalcinosis: due to mutations in the CCAL1 or CCAL2 genes

---
# Pathophysiology
Deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPP or CPPD) crystals in articular cartilage → paroxysmal joint inflammation and cartilage destruction → inflammatory arthritis (crystalline arthritis)

---
# Clinical features
## Acute CPP crystal arthritis (pseudogout)
- Clinical features
	- Acute attack of pain and swelling in the affected joint(s)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Monoarthritis</span> (occasionally oligoarthritis)
	- Most commonly affects the knee and wrist; can also affect other large joints (e.g., hips, ankles)
	- Typically self-limited
- Features that differ from acute gout
	- Longer duration of acute attacks 
		- Up to several months
	- Possible systemic symptoms
		- E.g., fever, chills, altered mental status in the elderly
## Chronic CPP crystal arthritis
- [[Osteoarthritis]]-like presentation (osteoarthritis with CPPD; pseudo-osteoarthritis)
	- Most common form of CPPD disease
	- Characterized by progressive joint degeneration
		- Usually polyarticular; can occur in joints not typically affected by OA 
		- More severe than typical OA
		- Often associated with pseudogout-like flares of acute inflammatory arthritis
