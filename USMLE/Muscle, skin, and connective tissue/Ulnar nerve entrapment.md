# Pathophysiology
The ulnar nerve is most commonly compressed at or near the cubital tunnel of the elbow and Guyon canal of the wrist.![[Pasted image 20230919165808.png]]

# Clinical features
## Motor symptoms
- Entrapment at the elbow
	- Less common than sensory complaints and range from mild to severe weakness
	- Muscle atrophy and weakness
		- Loss of dexterity
		- Decreased grip strength
		- Difficulty lifting
- Entrapment at the wrist: weakness and atrophy of the intrinsic hand muscles innervated by the ulnar nerve
## Sensory symptoms
- Entrapment at the elbow
	- Paresthesia or sensory loss of palmar and dorsal aspects of the medial side of the hand, little finger, and ulnar side of the ring finger
	- Referred pain in the forearm 
- Entrapment at the wrist
	- Variable paresthesia or sensory loss of the palmar and dorsal aspects of the medial side of the hand, little finger, and ulnar side of the ring finger
## Physical examination
- Ulnar claw 
	- Palsy of the 3rd and 4th lumbricals with preserved function of the extrinsic flexors 
	- Present at rest, increases when the patient is asked to extend the fingers
	- Mainly seen in distal ulnar nerve injuries

	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Flexion of the thumb at the interphalangeal joint elicited when tightly pressing together the tips of the index finger and thumb, or when tightly adducting the thumb against the 2nd metacarpal (e.g., pinching a piece of paper using the thumb)</span> ![[Pasted image 20230919170423.png]]
	- Due to weakness of the adductor pollicis muscle and the unopposed action of flexor pollicis longus
