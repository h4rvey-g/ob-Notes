# Epidemiology
- Poliovirus is still endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

---
# Etiology
- Fecal-oral: absorption of poliovirus in the intestinal tract
- Incubation time: 7-14 days

---
# Pathophysiology
The virus replicates in the gastrointestinal tract (oropharynx and small intestine) following oral ingestion → enters the bloodstream → potential invasion of the gray matter of the spinal cord (particularly the lower motor neurons of the anterior horn) → myelitis

---
# Clinical features
>[!tip] 
>Over 72% of infections with poliovirus are asymptomatic. Clinical infection (mostly flu-like symptoms) is observed in less than 24% of cases and less than 1% of infected individuals develop paralysis.

- Fever, malaise, headache, nausea
- Severe back, neck, and muscle pain
- Asymmetric acute flaccid paralysis worsens over hours to days
	- Most commonly affects the leg muscles
	- Paralysis is usually more severe in proximal muscles than in distal muscles.
	- Ascending paralysis with diaphragmatic involvement → respiratory failure
