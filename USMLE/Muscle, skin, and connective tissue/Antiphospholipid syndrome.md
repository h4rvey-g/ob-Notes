# Pathophysiology
- Formation of procoagulatory antiphospholipid antibodies 
	- Antibodies form complexes with anticoagulant proteins, thereby inactivating them (e.g., protein C, protein S, antithrombin III).
	- Antibodies activate platelets and vascular endothelium. 
- Induction of a hypercoagulable state → ↑ risk of thrombosis and embolism [3]
