# Pathophysiology
- Formation of procoagulatory antiphospholipid antibodies 
	- Antibodies form complexes with anticoagulant proteins, thereby inactivating them (e.g., protein C, protein S, antithrombin III).
	- Antibodies activate platelets and vascular endothelium. 
- Induction of a hypercoagulable state → ↑ risk of thrombosis and embolism [3]
# Clinical features
APS usually manifests with recurring thrombotic events that may affect any organ.
Pregnancy-related: recurrent miscarriages and premature births.(Caused by thrombosis of [placental](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/Do01VS#Z414c23d8bf8265247dd2e1e7e9b0d89c) vessels and possible subsequent [placental](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/Do01VS#Z414c23d8bf8265247dd2e1e7e9b0d89c) [infarction](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/VP0GdT#Zb11fb76135fecdea9dd3e778dbe469e3))
> <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Thrombosis in APS is typically unprovoked (e.g., [unprovoked DVT](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/fh0kWf#Z15a08304a073ea63bd825729a0b8e82f)), recurrent, and/or manifests in unusual sites (e.g., [kidneys](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/m60VlS#Z517d2cc21845787cbf2c6ff27c21cd8e), [liver](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/j60_kS#Zd0ed3eb208321943f24b364e0a464294), [retina](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/cp0aoS#Zafbc538c70facdb76c5c65393ad05dbb)). It is most commonly seen in younger individuals (< 50 years of age) and in individuals with comorbid autoimmune diseases (e.g., [SLE](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/dT0op2#Zc038efa4f85b330e4a8d1d0224d5f1a9)).</mark>
