## Androgen deprivation
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Androgens accelerate the growth of prostate cancer.</span> Androgen deprivation by reduction of testosterone production or inhibition of testosterone binding to the androgen receptor on cancer cells is an important aspect of treating advanced or high-risk prostate cancer.
### Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)
- Definition: therapy designed to decrease testosterone production by the testes
- Indications
	- Locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer: primary treatment modality
- Options
	- Medical castration: decreases pituitary stimulation of androgen production by the testes
		- Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists (e.g., leuprolide)
	- Surgical castration: bilateral orchiectomy
### Androgen synthesis inhibitors and androgen receptor antagonists
- Indication: adjunct to ADT in locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer
- Androgen receptor antagonists (antiandrogen therapy)
	- Mechanism of action: displaces androgens from androgen receptors
	- Commonly used agents: apalutamide and enzalutamide (second-generation antiandrogens)
