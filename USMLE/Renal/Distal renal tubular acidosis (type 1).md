# Pathophysiology
The α-intercalated cells of the distal tubule are unable to secrete H+ (apical) → ↓ intracellular production of HCO3-  → ↓ HCO3-/Cl- exchanger activity (basolateral) → decreased concentration of HCO3- in the blood → metabolic acidosis

# Clinical features
- Nephrocalcinosis: calcium phosphate stones (due to an increase in urine pH
- Bone demineralization usually without overt rickets or osteomalacia (due to increased bone turnover)
- Impaired growth
