# Etiology
Autosomal recessive defect in the SLC12A3 gene on chromosome 16p → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impaired function of the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule → impaired Na+ and Cl- reabsorption → mild natriuresis → mild volume depletion → mild RAAS activation</span>![[8cb7101c258b7164a5f019665a6967b.jpg]]

# Clinical features
Clinical features are similar to those of chronic thiazide diuretic use:
- Fatigue, muscle weakness
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Muscle cramps and/or tetany</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mild polyuria</span>

# Diagnostics
- Metabolic alkalosis
- Severe hypokalemia
- [[Hypercalcemia]] and hypocalciuria 
	- Decreased intracellular sodium levels increase the activity of the basolateral Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in the cells of the distal convoluted tubule. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sodium is transported into, and calcium out of, the cell</span>, resulting in decreased intracellular calcium concentration that leads to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased reabsorption from the lumen via luminal Ca2+ channels</span>. Calcium reabsorption may also be increased because of increased uptake of sodium and calcium in the proximal tubule as a result of sodium depletion.
- Hypomagnesemia
