## Calcium oxalate stones
### Etiology
- Hypercalciuria
- Hyperoxaluria
	- Increased intestinal absorption of oxalate, e.g., due to fatty acid malabsorption (e.g., Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, short bowel syndrome)
	 - [[Vitamin C# Vitamin C toxicity]]
		 - [[Vitamin C]] is metabolized to oxalate
- Hypocitraturia
### Diagnosis
- Urine microscopy: dumbbell-shaped or octahedron-shaped crystals ![[Pasted image 20230817154316.png]]
- X-ray (or CT): radiopaque stones
>[!tip] 
>Serum calcium can be normal or elevated.
### Treatment
- Hydration
- Dietary modification
	- Reduced intake of salt (mainly sodium) and animal protein *(Low sodium enhances renal tubular reabsorption of sodium and calcium, decreasing urinary calcium levels. Animal protein consumption increases calcium excretion in urine.)*
	- Reduced intake of oxalate-rich foods and supplemental [[vitamin C]]
	- Calcium intake should not be restricted (restriction increases risk of hyperoxaluria, and thereby, the risk for osteoporosis) 
- Thiazide diuretics for recurrent calcium-containing stones with idiopathic hypercalciuria (i.e., no [[hypercalcemia]]) 
- Urine alkalinization (e.g., with potassium citrate)
- Possibly citrate supplementation
## Uric acid stones
### Etiology
- Hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria
	- Gout
	- High cell turnover (e.g., [[tumor lysis syndrome]], [[Myelodysplastic syndromes|myelodysplastic syndrome]])
- Diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome
- Chronic diarrhea
### Diagnosis
- Urine microscopy: rhomboid/needle-shaped crystals ![[Pasted image 20230817160628.png]]
- X-ray: radiolucent stones
- CT: can be visible but are usually only minimally visible (not as visible as calcium stones)
### Treatment
- Hydration
- Oral chemolitholysis (e.g., potassium citrate) via urine alkalinization 
	- Uric acid stones are unique in that they can usually be dissolved by alkalizing the urine. In other stones, urine alkalinization is used for prophylaxis rather than treatment.
- Low-purine diet
- Allopurinol
>[!Mnemonic] 
>**U**ric acid stones are radiol**U**cent (x-ray negative).

>[!warning] 
>Uricosuric agents (e.g., probenecid) increase the excretion of uric acid, which can accelerate the formation of stones.
## Cystine stones
### Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Autosomal recessive defect in cystine-reabsorbing PCT transporter</span> → impaired proximal renal tubular absorption of dibasic amino acids → cystinuria → cystine stone formation (as cystine is poorly soluble)
- Develop in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">persistently acidic urine</span>
### Clinical features
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Recurrent kidney stones (manifesting with e.g., flank pain) starting <u>in childhood</u></span>
### Diagnosis
- Urine microscopy: hexagonal crystals 
- X-ray (or CT)
	- Weakly radiopaque stones
	- Possibly staghorn calculi
- Positive cyanide nitroprusside test
