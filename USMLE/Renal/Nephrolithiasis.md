# Etiology


---
# Classifications
## Calcium oxalate stones
### Etiology
- Hypercalciuria
- Hyperoxaluria
- Hypocitraturia
- Associated with inflammatory bowel disease, i.e., ulcerative colitis and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Crohn disease due to malabsorption</span>
## Uric acid stones
### Etiology
- Hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria
	- Gout
	- High cell turnover (e.g., [[tumor lysis syndrome]], myelodysplastic syndrome)
- Diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome
- Chronic diarrhea
### Diagnosis
- Urine microscopy: rhomboid/needle-shaped crystals 
- X-ray: radiolucent stones
- CT: can be visible but are usually only minimally visible (not as visible as calcium stones)
### Treatment
- Hydration
- Oral chemolitholysis (e.g., potassium citrate) via urine alkalinization 
	- Uric acid stones are unique in that they can usually be dissolved by alkalizing the urine. In other stones, urine alkalinization is used for prophylaxis rather than treatment.
- Low-purine diet
- Allopurinol
>[!Mnemonic] 
>**U**ric acid stones are radiol**U**cent (x-ray negative).

>[!warning] 
>Uricosuric agents (e.g., probenecid) increase the excretion of uric acid, which can accelerate the formation of stones.
