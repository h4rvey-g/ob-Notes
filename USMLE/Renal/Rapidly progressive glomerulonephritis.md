# Etiology


---
# Pathophysiology
- Breaks in the glomerular capillary wall and dysfunction of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) → leakage of plasma proteins (e.g., coagulation factors) and passage of inflammatory cells (macrophages, T cells) into Bowman space
- Release of inflammatory cytokines → damage to the membrane of Bowman space and passage of cells from the interstitium into Bowman space
- This causes the formation of fibrin clots and proliferation of cells (e.g., macrophages, fibroblasts, neutrophils, epithelial cells) → crescent moon formation → compression of the glomerulus → renal dysfunction
