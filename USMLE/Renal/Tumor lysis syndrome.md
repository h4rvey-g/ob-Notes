# Definition
A <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">potentially life-threatening oncologic emergency</mark> resulting from the rapid destruction of tumor cells, which leads to a massive release of intracellular components, e.g., potassium (K+), phosphate (PO43-), and uric acid, that can damage the **kidneys** and cause renal failure.

# Etiology
most commonly <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">occurs after initiating cytotoxic treatment</mark> in patients with hematologic malignancies (e.g., ALL, AML, or NHL).most commonly occurs after initiating cytotoxic treatment in patients with hematologic malignancies (e.g., ALL, AML, or NHL).

# Pathophysiology
Tumor cell lysis → release of intracellular components (e.g., K+, PO43-, nucleic acids) into the bloodstream
- ↑ Nucleic acid → conversion to uric acid → hyperuricemia → urate nephropathy and risk of acute kidney injury 
- ↓ Ca2+ secondary to PO43- binding → hypocalcemia → neuronal excitability → risk of seizures
- Hyperphosphatemia: PO43- binds Ca2+ and forms calcium phosphate crystals that obstruct renal tubules → acute kidney injury
- Hyperkalemia: changes in resting membrane potential → risk of cardiac arrhythmias

# Clinical features
- Renal failure: e.g., edema, lethargy, oliguria
- Hyperkalemia: e.g., cardiac arrhythmias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
- Hypocalcemia: e.g., tetany, muscle cramps, seizures
