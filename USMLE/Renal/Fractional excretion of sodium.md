Definition: percentage of the glomerular filtered sodium (Na<sub>Filtered</sub>) that is eventually excreted in the urine (Na<sub>Excreted</sub>)
# Usage
- Can help establish the cause of acute kidney injury 
- Can help distinguish between renal and extrarenal etiology in hypotonic hyponatremia (see “Diagnostic approach to hyponatremia”)
# Calculation
Filtered Na = Na<sub>Plasma</sub> x GFR
Excretion rate of Na = Na<sub>Urine</sub> x V 
$$Fe_{Na}=$$
FeNa = NaExcreted / NaFiltered 
FeNa = (NaUrine x V) / (NaPlasma x GFR) 
FeNa = (NaUrine x V) / (NaPlasmax [CreaUrine x V / CreaPlasma]) 
FeNa = (NaUrine x CreaPlasma) / (NaPlasmax CreaUrine) 
Interpretation
In acute kidney injury
Low FeNa (< 1%): indicates a prerenal cause (renal hypoperfusion)
High FeNa (> 2%): indicates an intrarenal etiology (e.g., acute tubular necrosis)
Inconclusive FeNa (1–2%): can be seen with either disorder
In hypotonic hyponatremia
Low FeNa (< 1%): extrarenal cause
High FeNa (> 1%): renal cause
