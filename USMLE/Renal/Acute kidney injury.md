- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Decreased blood supply to kidneys (due to hypovolemia, hypotension, or renal vasoconstriction)</span> → failure of renal vascular autoreg<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"></span>ulation to maintain renal perfusion <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">→ decreased GFR → activation of renin-angiotensin system → increased aldosterone release → increased reabsorption of Na+, H2O → increased urine osmolality → secretion of antidiuretic hormone → increased reabsorption of H2O and urea</span>
- Creatinine is still secreted in the proximal tubules, so the blood [[BUN-creatinine ratio|BUN:creatinine ratio]] increases.
