# Etiology
- Primary: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">anti-PLA2R antibodies</span>
- Secondary:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Infections (HBV, HCV, malaria</span>, syphilis)
	- Autoimmune diseases (e.g., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Systemic lupus erythematosus|SLE]]</span>)
	- Tumors (e.g., [[lung cancer]], prostate cancer)
	- Medications (e.g., NSAIDs, penicillamine, gold)
