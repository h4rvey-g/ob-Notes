# Pathophysiology
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chronic hyperglycemia → glycation (also called non-enzymatic glycosylation or NEG) of the basement membrane (protein glycation) → increased permeability and thickening of the basement membrane and stiffening of the efferent arteriole → hyperfiltration (increase in GFR) → increase in intraglomerular pressure  → progressive glomerular hypertrophy, increase in renal size, and glomerular scarring (glomerulosclerosis) → worsening of filtration capacity</span>
