# Epidemiology
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bimodal age distribution; mostly affects children (between the ages of 3–12 years) and patients > 60 years of age</span>

---
# Etiology
Prior infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GAS)

---
# Pathophysiology
Infection with nephritogenic strains of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">immune complexes</span> containing the streptococcal antigen deposit within the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">glomerular basement membrane (Type III hypersensitivity reaction)</span> → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">complement activation</span> (↑ consumption of complement factors) → destruction of the glomeruli → immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis and [[nephritic syndrome]]

---
# Clinical features
Approx. 50% of patients remain asymptomatic. Symptoms occur approximately 1–6 weeks following an acute infection.
- [[Nephritic syndrome]]
	- Hematuria:<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> tea- or cola-colored urine</span>
	- Hypertension: can lead to [[headaches]]
	- Edema (prominent facial edema) 
	- Oliguria
- Influenza-like symptoms 
- Flank pain

# Diagnostics
## Initial evaluation
- Urinalysis with microscopy: nephritic sediment
- C3 complement, C4 complement levels: classically shows ↓ C3 complement with normal C4 complement
>[!tip] 
>If both C3 and C4 complement levels are decreased, consider other causes of glomerulonephritis with low serum complement levels and possible nonrenal causes of low complement levels (e.g., liver failure, nonrenal protein-losing conditions).

## Evidence of preceding GAS infection
- Antistreptococcal antibody titers
	- Findings: ↑ ASO, ↑ anti-DNase B antibodies
- Isolation of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci
	- Pharyngitis: rapid strep test, throat culture
	- Skin lesions: wound cultures
