# Epidemiology
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bimodal age distribution; mostly affects children (between the ages of 3–12 years) and patients > 60 years of age</span>

---
# Etiology
Prior infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GAS)

---
# Pathophysiology
Infection with nephritogenic strains of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">immune complexes</span> containing the streptococcal antigen deposit within the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">glomerular basement membrane (Type III hypersensitivity reaction)</span> → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">complement activation</span> (↑ consumption of complement factors) → destruction of the glomeruli → immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis and nephritic syndrome
