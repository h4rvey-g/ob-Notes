# Epidemiology

# Etiology
- Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is a potent prostatic growth factor.
- Androgen-estrogen imbalance: As men age, testosterone levels decline, but estrogen levels remain the same, which results in a higher estrogen/testosterone ratio.

	- Total PSA > 1.5 ng/mL: suggests an enlarged prostate (> 40 mL) 
	- Total PSA > 4 ng/mL: increased likelihood of prostate cancer
- Free PSA levels and free PSA/total PSA ratio
	- ↑ Free PSA levels and ↑ free PSA/total PSA ratio: usually seen in BPH
	- ↓ Free PSA levels and ↓ free PSA/total PSA ratio: suggestive of prostate cancer
