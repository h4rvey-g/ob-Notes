# Etiology
IgA nephropathy is the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">most common primary glomerulonephritis in adults.</span>
Peak incidence: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">20-30 years old</span>

# Pathophysiology
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">An increased number of defective, circulating IgA antibodies are synthesized</span> (often triggered by mucosal infections, i.e., upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal infections) → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">IgA antibodies form immune complexes that deposit in the renal mesangium</span> → mesangial cell and complement system activation → glomerulonephritis (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">type III hypersensitivity reaction</span>)

# Clinical features
- Recurring episodes of:
	- Gross or microscopic hematuria
	- Flank pain
	- Low-grade fever
	- And/or [[nephritic syndrome]] (including hypertension)
	- Usually during or immediately following a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection [6] 
- Can progress to [[Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis|RPGN]] and/or nephrotic syndrome (< 10% of patients)
- Up to 50% of patients progress to end-stage renal disease within 20–25 years.

>[!tip] 
>IgA nephropathy and IgA vasculitis are both IgA-mediated vasculitides triggered by a mucosal infection. IgA vasculitis most commonly occurs in children < 10 years of age and affects multiple organ systems (palpable purpura, abdominal pain, arthralgia). IgA nephropathy is limited to the kidneys and typically affects adults.
