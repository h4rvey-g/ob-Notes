# Etiology


---
# Pathology
Renal cell carcinomas are adenocarcinomas that usually arise from the epithelial cells of the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">proximal convoluted tubule</span> (80%).
- Clear cell renal cell carcinoma
	- Frequency: 70%
	- Etiology: Sporadic or inherited mutation of VHL gene on chromosome 3p
 
 >[!Mnemonic] 
>Rule of **3**: A mutation in the **VHL** (von Hippel-Lindau) gene on chromosome **3** causes **RCC** (renal cell carcinoma).

# Clinical features
- Constitutional symptoms
	- Weight loss, fatigue
	- Fever, night sweats 
	- [[Anemia]]
- Symptoms caused by primary tumor
	- Hematuria 
	- Flank pain 
	- Palpable renal mass

# Diagnostics


---
# Differential diagnosis
## Benign renal masses
### Oncocytoma
- Definition: benign epithelial tumor arising from the intercalated tubular cells in the collecting duct
- Clinical features 
	- Painless hematuria
	- Abdominal mass
	- Flank pain
- Pathology
	- Macroscopy: smooth, clearly defined brown tumor with central radial scar ![[Pasted image 20230820154628.png]]
	- Microscopy
	- Large acidophilic cells 
	- Excessive amount of mitochondria â†’ acidophilic, granular cytoplasm without perinuclear clearing (unlike chromophobe RCC)
- Treatment
	- Often resected in order to exclude RCC
	- Surveillance

# Complications
## Complications caused by [[paraneoplastic syndromes]]
- Secondary hypercortisolism: due to ectopic ACTH release
- Secondary polycythemia: due to ectopic erythropoietin (EPO) secretion
- Hypertension: due to the release of renin
- [[Hypercalcemia]]: due to the release of [[Parathyroid hormone-related protein|PTHrP]] (parathyroid hormone-related protein)
