# Epidemiology
- Peak incidence: between 2 and 5 years 
- Most common malignant neoplasm of the kidney in children

---
# Etiology
Can be associated with loss-of-function mutations of tumor suppressor genes WT1 or WT2 on chromosome 11 (W11ms tumor).
## Associated syndromes
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">WAGR syndrome</span>: Deletion of the 11p13 band leads to the deletion of the WT1 gene and other genes, such as PAX6. [6]
	- Nephroblastoma
	- Aniridia 
	- Genitourinary anomalies
		- Pseudohermaphroditism, undescended testes in males (due to gonadal dysgenesis)
		- Early-onset [[nephrotic syndrome]]
	- Range of intellectual disability
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Denys-Drash syndrome</span>: point mutation in WT1 gene, which encodes a zinc finger transcription factor [7]
	- Nephroblastoma
	- Pseudohermaphroditism, undescended testes in males (due to gonadal dysgenesis)
	- Early-onset [[nephrotic syndrome]] caused by diffuse mesangial sclerosis
- Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome: mutations of the WT2 gene
