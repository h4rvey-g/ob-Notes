# Epidemiology
- [[Stress incontinence]] and mixed incontinence are the most common types of incontinence in female patients.
- Urge incontinence is the most common type in male patients.

---
# Etiology
- Neurological causes
	- Multiple sclerosis
	- Spinal injury
	- Normal-pressure hydrocephalus
- Genitourinary causes
	- Trauma to the pelvic floor 
	- Intrinsic sphincter deficiency
	- Urethral hypermobility in women
	- Impaired detrusor contractility
	- Bladder outlet obstruction
	- Pelvic floor weakness
- Transient causes of urinary incontinence
	- Drugs (e.g., diuretics)
	- [[Urinary tract infections]]
	- Postmenopausal atrophic urethritis
	- Psychiatric causes (especially depression, delirium/confused state)
	- Excessive urinary output (in conditions like hyperglycemia, [[hypercalcemia]], CHF)
	- Stool impaction
- General risk factors
	- Recurrent [[urinary tract infections]]
 >[!Mnemonic] 
>To remember the reversible causes of acute urinary incontinence, think DIAPPERS: Delirium/confusion, Infection, Atrophic urethritis/vaginitis, Pharmaceutical, Psychiatric causes (especially depression), Excessive urinary output (hyperglycemia, [[hypercalcemia]], CHF), Restricted mobility, Stool impaction.

# Classifications
## Overflow incontinence
### Mechanism
- Impaired (weak) detrusor contractility
- Bladder outlet obstruction (e.g., BPH)
- Both mechanisms can lead to incomplete bladder emptying → bladder overfilling → <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">chronically distended bladder with ↑ bladder pressure → dribbling of urine (leak) when intravesical pressure > outlet resistance</mark>
### Clinical features
- Frequent, involuntary intermittent/continuous dribbling of urine in the absence of an urge to urinate
- Occurs only when the bladder is full
- Postvoid residual urine volume *(seen on ultrasound or with catherization)*
### Treatment
- [[Intermittent catheterization]]: for scheduled bladder emptying
	- Intermittent -> prevention of catheter-associated UTIs and is favored by most patients; indwelling catheters may be considered if necessary.

>[!warning] 
>The use of muscarinic agonists may lead to urinary urgency, while the use of sympathomimetics or muscarinic antagonists may lead to urinary retention, especially if there is an untreated outlet obstruction.

>[!tip] 
>No pharmacological therapies are FDA-approved for stress incontinence; treatment is primarily conservative with surgery.
