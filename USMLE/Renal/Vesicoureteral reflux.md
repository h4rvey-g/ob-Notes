# Etiology
## Primary VUR (most common type)
Short intramural ureter → vesicoureteric junction (VUJ) fails to close completely during bladder contraction → VUR![[Pasted image 20230823171919.png]]
## Secondary VUR
- Bladder outlet obstruction (anatomic/functional): high pressure within the bladder → reflux of urine through the VUJ![[Pasted image 20230823172334.png]]
- Anatomic: posterior urethral valves ; urethral meatal stenosis
