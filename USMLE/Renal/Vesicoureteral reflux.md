# Epidemiology
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Age: children &lt; 2 years</span>

# Etiology
## Primary VUR (most common type)
Short intramural ureter → vesicoureteric junction (VUJ) fails to close completely during bladder contraction → VUR![[Pasted image 20230823171919.png]]
## Secondary VUR
- Bladder outlet obstruction (anatomic/functional): high pressure within the bladder → reflux of urine through the VUJ![[Pasted image 20230823172334.png]]
- Anatomic: posterior urethral valves ; urethral meatal stenosis

# Pathophysiology

# Clinical features
- Suspected in the prenatal period when <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hydronephrosis</span> is detected on routine antenatal ultrasound
- Postnatal presentation
	- Recurrent febrile [[urinary tract infections]]
		- Neonates: irritability, fever, and listlessness
		- Older children: urinary urgency, frequency, incontinence, and dysuria associated with fever
	- Reflux nephropathy : renovascular hypertension, kidney failure, uremia

>[!tip] 
>VUR is generally asymptomatic until it causes a urinary tract infection.
