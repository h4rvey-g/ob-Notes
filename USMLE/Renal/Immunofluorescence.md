## Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis
### Type I MPGN:
Electron microscopy: Characterised by the presence of discrete subendothelial electron dense deposits
Mesangial and occasional subepithelial deposits may also be present
Immunoflouresence shows IgG, IgM and C3 deposited in a glanular pattern and every complement components (C1Q and C4) are often also present indicating are immune complexes pathogenesis
### Type II MPGN
Is characterised by deposition of dark, ribbon like electron dense material in the central layer of (Lamina Densa) of glomerular basement membrane
Immunofluorescence – C3 deposition on both sides of the basement membrane in irregular granular or linear pattern
C3 can also be identified in mesangium in the ring shaped aggregates
