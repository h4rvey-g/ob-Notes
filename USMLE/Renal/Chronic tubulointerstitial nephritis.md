Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis (CTIN) is a condition of chronic inflammation of the renal tubules and interstitium and can progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) after months or years.
# Pathophysiology
- Analgesic nephropathy (e.g., resulting from NSAID use)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Inhibition of prostacyclin synthesis → vasoconstriction of the medullary blood vessels → papillary ischemia and papillary necrosis</span>
	- Associated with an increased risk of urothelial carcinoma; can progress to ESRD
# Etiology
- Medications
	- Analgesic nephropathy: combination analgesics , NSAIDs, and acetaminophen
