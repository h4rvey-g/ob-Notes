# The nephron
## Proximal convoluted tubule (PCT)
1. Bicarbonate
	1. Don't change H+, only absorb HCO<sup>3-</sup>![[Pasted image 20230829151420.png]]
	2. Absorb Na+ to absorb H<sub>2</sub>O. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">65% of sodium and water are absorbed in PCT</span>.
	3. Angiotensin II increases Na+, HCO3-, and H2O reabsorption via Na+/H+ exchanger stimulation (allows for contraction alkalosis).
2. Parathormone (PTH) decreases PO43- reabsorption via Na+-PO43- cotransporter inhibition.
3. Brush border resorption of most of the ultrafiltrate
	- Glucose (via SGLT2)
	- Amino acids
	- Uric acid
	- Na+, Cl-, K+, HCO3-, PO43-, and H2O<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> (All together with Na+ !!!)</span>![[Pasted image 20230829152436.png]]
## Thick ascending loop of Henle
1. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">ADH stimulates the activity of NKCC2</span>. Increased NKCC2 activity aids in water reabsorption in the collecting duct through aquaporin 2 channels by creating a hypo-osmotic filtrate.
## Distal convoluted tubule (DCT)
1. Magnesium and Calcium are reabsorbed paracellularly.
2. Ca2+ is reabsorbed using Ca2+ channels on the luminal surface and Na+/Ca2+ antiporters (exchangers) on the basolateral surface.![[Pasted image 20230829155253.png]]
	1. PTH up-regulates the Ca2+/Na+ antiporter resulting in increased reabsorption of Ca2+.
## Collecting duct
1. Principal cells
	1. Reabsorb Na+ and H2O, but secrete K+
	2. When acted upon by ADH, principal cells will increase the number of aquaporins (water channels) on the luminal membrane → increased H2O reabsorption.
	3. When acted upon by aldosterone, principal cells increase activity of Na+/K+ exchangers → increased Na+ reabsorption and increased K+ secretion.![[Pasted image 20230829161022.png]]
2. Alpha-intercalated cells
	1. Have a K+/H+ exchanger on the luminal surface to secrete H+ and reabsorb K+
	2. Have a H+-ATPase which actively secretes H+. On the basolateral surface, the cells have a HCO3 -/Cl- exchanger to reabsorb HCO3 -.
	3. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Aldosterone upregulates H+ secretion via H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Increased H+ secretion will lead to increased HCO<sup>3-</sup> reabsorption.</span>![[Pasted image 20230829160412.png]]
3. ADH also stimulates reabsorption of urea in collecting ducts to maximize corticopapillary osmotic gradient.
