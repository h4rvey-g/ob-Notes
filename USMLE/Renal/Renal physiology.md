# The nephron
## Proximal convoluted tubule (PCT)
1. Bicarbonate
	1. Don't change H+, only absorb HCO<sup>3-</sup>![[Pasted image 20230829151420.png]]
	2. Absorb Na+ to absorb H<sub>2</sub>O
	3. Angiotensin II increases Na+, HCO3-, and H2O reabsorption via Na+/H+ exchanger stimulation (allows for contraction alkalosis).
2. Parathormone (PTH) decreases PO43- reabsorption via Na+-PO43- cotransporter inhibition.
3. Brush border resorption of most of the ultrafiltrate
	- Glucose (via SGLT2)
	- Amino acids
	- Uric acid
	- Na+, Cl-, K+, HCO3-, PO43-, and H2O<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> (All together with Na+ !!!)</span>![[Pasted image 20230829152436.png]]
## Distal convoluted tubule (DCT)
1. Magnesium and Calcium are reabsorbed paracellularly.
2. Ca2+ is reabsorbed using Ca2+ channels on the luminal surface and Na+/Ca2+ antiporters (exchangers) on the basolateral surface.![[Pasted image 20230829155253.png]]
	1. PTH up-regulates the Ca2+/Na+ antiporter resulting in increased reabsorption of Ca2+.
