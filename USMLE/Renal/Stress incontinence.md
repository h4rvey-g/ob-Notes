# Epidemiology
Prevalence increases with age.

---
# Etiology
- Pathomechanism: outlet incompetence
	- Urethral hypermobility: loss of pelvic floor musculature and/or connective tissue support → weak pelvic floor → inability of the urethra to completely close
	- Intrinsic sphincter deficiency
- Risk factors
	- Multipara
	- Pregnancy and vaginal deliveries 
	- High-impact activity (e.g., jumping, running, hopping)
	- Menopause
	- Obesity
	- Smoking
	- Chronic cough (e.g., COPD)
	- Prostate or pelvic surgery

# Pathophysiology


---
# Clinical features
- Physical activity that causes increased intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., laughing, sneezing, coughing, exercising) leads to loss of urine
- Frequent, predictable, small-volume urine losses with no urge to urinate prior to the leakage

---
# Diagnostics


---
# Treatment
# Conservative treatment
- Kegel exercises 
- Lifestyle changes (e.g., weight loss, avoiding alcohol and caffeine, smoking cessation)
- Vaginal pessary
# Surgical procedures
- Indicated if conservative treatment does not provide sufficient improvement of symptoms
- Procedure of choice: midurethral sling to elevate the urethra
