# Urinary casts
Urinary casts are formed only in the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">distal convoluted tubule (DCT)</span> or the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">collecting duct (distal nephron)</span>. The proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) and loop of Henle are not locations for cast formation.
