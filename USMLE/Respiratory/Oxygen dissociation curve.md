- Causes of shift to the right include:
	- ↑ Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (↑ PCO2) 
	- ↑ Body temperature (e.g., fever)
	- ↑ H+ (↓ pH)
	- ↑ 2,3-BPG (generated by 2,3-BPG mutase during erythrocyte glycolysis)
	- ↑ Exercise
	- ↑ Altitude

	- ↓ H+ (↑ pH)
	- ↓ 2,3-BPG (e.g., due to mutations in the BPGM gene on chromosome 7) [4]
	- ↑ CO
	- ↑ Methemoglobin
	- ↑ Fetal hemoglobin (HbF)
