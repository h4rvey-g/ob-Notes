# Clinical features
## Typical pneumonia
Typical pneumonia is characterized by a sudden onset of symptoms caused by lobar infiltration.
- Severe malaise
- High fever and chills
- Productive cough with purulent sputum (yellow-greenish)
	- Crackles and bronchial breath sounds on auscultation
	- Decreased breath sounds
	- Enhanced bronchophony, egophony, and tactile fremitus
	- Dullness on percussion 
- Tachypnea and dyspnea (nasal flaring, thoracic retractions)

## Atypical pneumonia
Atypical pneumonia typically has an indolent course (slow onset) and commonly manifests with <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">extrapulmonary symptoms</mark>.
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">Nonproductive, dry cough</mark>
- Dyspnea
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">Auscultation often unremarkable</mark>
- Common extrapulmonary features include fatigue, headaches, sore throat, myalgias, and malaise.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">This classification does not have a major impact on patient management because it is not always possible to clearly distinguish between typical and atypical pneumonia.</mark>
# Pathogen-specific pneumonia
## Mycoplasma pneumonia
### Epidemiology
- One of the most common causes of atypical pneumonia
- More common in school-aged children and adolescents
- Outbreaks most commonly occur in schools, colleges, prisons, and military facilities.
### Clinical features
- Generalized papular rash
- Erythema multiforme 
- [[Pneumonia#Atypical pneumonia]]
### Diagnostics
- Subclinical hemolytic [[anemia]]: associated with elevated cold agglutinin titers (IgM)
- Interstitial pneumonia, often with a reticulonodular pattern on chest x-ray
- Chest x-ray can show extensive pulmonary involvement in patients with mild pneumonia.
