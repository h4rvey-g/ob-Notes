# Etiology
- Risk factors for asthma include:
    - Family history of asthma
    - Past history of allergies
    - [[Atopic dermatitis]]
    - Low socioeconomic status
- Allergic asthma (extrinsic asthma) vs Nonallergic asthma (intrinsic asthma)
	-  ![[Pasted image 20230803144309.png]]
>[!tip] 
> - Allergic asthma (extrinsic asthma): A type of asthma triggered by allergens (e.g., pollen, dust mites, mold spores, pet allergens). Typically onset in childhood.
> - Nonallergic asthma (intrinsic asthma): A type of asthma that typically develops in patients > 40 years of age.

# Pathophysiology
### Common underlying pathophysiology
Asthma is an inflammatory disease driven by [T-helper](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/x50Emg#Z6a2460ca0dfc90387c336ab076439b5c) type 2 cells ([Th2-cell](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/x50Emg#Z59080180352611810fa453a84c8c48cd)) that manifests in individuals with a genetic predisposition. It consists of the following three pathophysiologic processes:

1. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness
2. Bronchial inflammation
3. Endobronchial obstruction caused by:
	- Increased parasympathetic tone
		- Reversible bronchospasm
		- Increased mucus production
		- Mucosal edema and leukocyte infiltration into the mucosa with hyperplasia of goblet cells
	- Hypertrophy of smooth muscle cells
### Type-specific pathophysiology
- Allergic asthma
	- IgE-mediated type 1 hypersensitivity to a specific allergen
	- Characterized by mast cell degranulation and release of histamine after a prior phase of sensitization
- Nonallergic asthma
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">Irritant asthma: irritant enters lung → ↑ release of neutrophils → submucosal edema → airway obstruction</mark>
	- Aspirin-induced asthma (NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease) is characterized by the Samter triad:
		- Inhibition of COX-1 → ↓ PGE2  → ↑ leukotrienes and inflammation → submucosal edema → airway obstruction
		- Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis
		- Asthma symptoms

# Treatment
## Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs)
- Montelukast, Zafirlukast
- Uses
	- Exercise-induced
	- Prevent leukotrienes from binding to their receptors (CysLT1)→ ↓ bronchoconstriction and inflammation
	- Asthma aspirin-induced asthma
	- Long-term maintenance treatment (particularly in children)
## Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA)
- Tiotropium bromide（噻托溴铵）
- Long-term maintenance treatment
## Leukotriene pathway modifiers
- Zileuton
- Inhibit 5-lipoxygenase → ↓ production of leukotrienes → ↓ bronchoconstriction and inflammation
- Uses
	- Exercise-induced asthma
	- Aspirin-induced asthma
## Biologics
### Anti-IgE antibodies
- Omalizumab [[单抗记忆]]
- Binds to serum IgE → ↓ expression of high-affinity IgE receptors (FcεRI) on mast cells and basophils
- Uses
	- Select cases of severe asthma
### IL-5 antibodies
-  mepolizumab, reslizumab,benralizumab
- Block the effects of IL-5 on eosinophils → ↓ chemotaxis and ↓ cell differentiation, maturation, and activation
- Uses
	- Refractory severe eosinophilic asthma
