# Definition
- Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA): a hypersensitivity reaction caused by exposure to Aspergillus that mostly occurs in patients with [[cystic fibrosis]] or [[asthma]]
- Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis: a long-term Aspergillus infection of the lung which can manifest as:
	- Aspergilloma: an opportunistic infection of a pre-existing cavitary lesion (e.g. from previous tuberculosis)
	- Chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis: a subacute and semi-invasive form of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis characterized by localized, slowly progressive, inflammatory destruction of lung tissue and commonly associated with alcohol use disorder
- Invasive aspergillosis: a severe form of Aspergillus infection which manifests with severe [[pneumonia]] and septicemia with potential involvement of other organs (e.g., skin, CNS) and mostly occurs in immunocompromised individuals
