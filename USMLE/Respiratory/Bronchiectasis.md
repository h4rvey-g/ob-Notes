# Etiology
Bronchiectasis requires the combination of two important processes taking place in the bronchi: 
- either local infection 
- or inflammation along with either inadequate clearance of secretions, airway obstruction, or impaired host defenses. 
These processes result in the permanent dilation of airways.
- Pulmonary infections (i.e., bacterial, viral, fungal), especially severe or chronic infections 
- Disorders of secretion clearance or mucous plugging
	- Cystic fibrosis (CF)  (Most common congenital cause of bronchiectasis)
	- Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)
	- Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)
	- Kartagener syndrome
	- Smoking: associated with poor ciliary motility
- Bronchial narrowing or other forms of obstruction
	- COPD
	- Aspiration
	- Tumors
- Immunodeficiency (e.g., common variable immunodeficiency, hypogammaglobulinemia, HIV)

# Pathophysiology


---
# Clinical features
- Chronic productive cough (lasting months to years) with copious mucopurulent sputum
> The sputum may be green or yellow in color.
- Auscultation
	- Crackles and rhonchi
	- Wheezing
- Dyspnea
- Hemoptysis
- Exacerbations of bronchiectasis
    - Recurrent bouts of pneumonia and acute bacterial infection of sections of dilated bronchi
    - Frequently due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa
    - Features
        - Increased production of mucous above baseline
        - Low-grade fever

> [!NOTE] Note
> Bronchiectasis should be suspected in patients with a chronic cough that produces large amounts of sputum.
