# Classic presentation
- HiIar lymphadenopathy
- Cough, dyspnea
- Often asymptomatic, detected on routine chest x-ray
# Etiology


---
# Pathophysiology
Sarcoidosis is a systemic disorder characterized by widespread, immune-mediated formation of <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">noncaseating granulomas</mark>.
- A nodular collection of macrophages that forms as a result of inflammation without central necrosis. Associated with sarcoidosis, berylliosis, and Crohn disease.

>[!tip] 
>Compared with TB, which has caseating granulomas.

- Calcium dysregulation: activated pulmonary alveolar macrophages → ↑ 1-alpha hydroxylase expression and activity → ↑ 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) → hypervitaminosis D → hyperphosphatemia, [[hypercalcemia]], and, possibly, renal failure

# Clinical features
## Pulmonary sarcoidosis
- Lungs are the most commonly affected organ (90% of affected individuals).
- Often asymptomatic in the early stages
- Classic finding is hilar lymphadenopathy
- Interstitial fibrosis
	- Cough, exertional dyspnea, chest pain
	- Mild rales on pulmonary auscultation
## Cutaneous sarcoidosis [8]
- Erythema nodosum: most common nonspecific cutaneous manifestation
