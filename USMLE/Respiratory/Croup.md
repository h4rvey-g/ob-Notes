# Epidemiology
- Peak incidence: 6 months to 3 years
- Most common in fall and winter
	- Viral infections are more likely to be acquired and transmitted in cold temperatures and dry air

---
# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common pathogen: parainfluenza viruses (75% of cases)</span>
- Other pathogens: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, influenza virus

---
# Pathophysiology
Viral infection → inflammation of the upper airway with edema formation and infiltration of inflammatory cells → narrowing of subglottic airway (inspiratory stridor) and increased work of breathing

---
# Clinical features
- Prodromal phase: 1–2 days of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms (rhinitis, low-grade fever, sore throat)
- Symptoms of croup last 2–7 days and typically manifest in the late evening/night.
- Characteristic features include<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> seal-like barking cough</span>, hoarseness, and inspiratory stridor due to subglottic narrowing.<iframe  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qbn1Zw5CTbA" title="baby with Croup Stridor Barking Cough visual &amp; audio sound - When to Hospitalize." frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

# Diagnostics
## Imaging
- X-ray chest and neck (anteroposterior and lateral)
