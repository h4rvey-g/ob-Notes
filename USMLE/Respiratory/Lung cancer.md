# Etiology

# Classifications
>[!tip] 
>Squamous and small cell carcinomas are sentral (central) and often caused by tobacco smoking.
## Adenocarcinoma
- Location: Peripheral
- Characteristics
	- Most common type of primary lung cancer
	- More common in women and <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">nonsmokers</mark>
	- Associated with mutations in: [13]
		- EGFR gene 
		- ALK gene 
		- KRAS gene
	- Common finding: hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (digital clubbing)
	- Most common type of lung cancer that originates in pulmonary scars [10]
	- Prognosis is usually better than in other types of lung cancer
 >[!note] 
 >“**A**denocarcinoma of **L**ung **K**inase”: Cancer (adenocarcinoma of lung) and the gene product (tyrosine kinase) are associated with ALK mutations.
## Large cell carcinoma
- Location: Peripheral
- Characteristics
	- Strong association with smoking
	- Poor response to chemotherapy
	- Early metastases
	- Poor prognosis
## Small cell lung cancer (SCLC)
- Location: Peripheral
- Characteristics
	- Strong association with <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">smoking</mark>

# Diagnostics
## Microscopic
### Adenocarcinoma
![[Pasted image 20230723153231.png]]
composed of columnar cells that proliferate along the framework of alveolar septae, a so-called "lepidic" growth pattern.
### Squamous cell carcinoma
![[Pasted image 20230723153407.png]]
- pink cytoplasm
- keratin pearls
- distinct cell border
### Large cell carcinoma
![[Pasted image 20230724161436.png]]
- Undifferentiated
- Large tumor cells
### Small cell carcinoma
![[Pasted image 20230723154313.png]]
This is the microscopic pattern of a small cell anaplastic (oat cell) carcinoma in which small dark blue cells with minimal cytoplasm are packed together in sheets.
### Hamartoma
![[Pasted image 20230723155339.png]]
composed mostly of benign cartilage on the right that is jumbled with a fibrovascular stroma and scattered bronchial glands on the left. A hamartoma is a neoplasm in an organ that is composed of tissue elements normally found at that site, but growing in a haphazard mass.
