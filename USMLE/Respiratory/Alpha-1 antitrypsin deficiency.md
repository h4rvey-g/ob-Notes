# Etiology
mutations in SERPINA1 gene

---
# Pathophysiology
- Alpha-1 antitrypsin: a protease inhibitor that is synthesized in the liver and protects cells from breakdown by neutrophil elastase
- Gene mutation induces a conformational change in the structure of AAT protein → dysfunctional (or absent) AAT
	- Effect on the liver: accumulation of AAT in hepatocellular endoplasmic reticulum → hepatocyte destruction → hepatitis and liver cirrhosis
	- Effect on the lungs: deficient AAT → uninhibited neutrophil elastase activity → destruction of the pulmonary parenchyma → panacinar emphysema
