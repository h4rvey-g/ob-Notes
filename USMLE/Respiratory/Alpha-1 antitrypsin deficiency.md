# Etiology
mutations in SERPINA1 gene

---
# Pathophysiology
- Alpha-1 antitrypsin: a protease inhibitor that is synthesized in the liver and protects cells from breakdown by neutrophil elastase
- Gene mutation induces a conformational change in the structure of AAT protein → dysfunctional (or absent) AAT
	- Effect on the liver: accumulation of AAT in hepatocellular endoplasmic reticulum → hepatocyte destruction → hepatitis and liver cirrhosis
	- Effect on the lungs: deficient AAT → uninhibited neutrophil elastase activity → destruction of the pulmonary parenchyma → panacinar emphysema

# Clinical features
- Pulmonary manifestations 
	- Cough, wheezing
	- Dyspnea
	- Diminished breath sounds
	- Barrel chest
 >[!tip] 
 >Adolescents presenting with pulmonary symptoms without a history of smoking should raise suspicion for AAT deficiency.
- Hepatic manifestations
	- Prolonged neonatal jaundice
	- Hepatitis
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">Cirrhosis</mark>
	- Increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
		- Patients with AAT deficiency are at risk of developing liver cirrhosis with subsequent HCC. HCC can also develop in the absence of cirrhosis.
