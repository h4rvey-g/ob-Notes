# Etiology
mutations in SERPINA1 gene

---
# Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Alpha-1 antitrypsin: a protease inhibitor that is synthesized in the liver and protects cells from breakdown by neutrophil elastase</span>
- Gene mutation induces a conformational change in the structure of AAT protein → dysfunctional (or absent) AAT
	- Effect on the liver: accumulation of AAT in hepatocellular endoplasmic reticulum → hepatocyte destruction → hepatitis and liver cirrhosis
	- Effect on the lungs: deficient AAT → uninhibited neutrophil elastase activity → destruction of the pulmonary parenchyma → panacinar emphysema

# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pulmonary manifestations </span>
	- Cough, wheezing
	- Dyspnea
	- Diminished breath sounds
	- Barrel chest

 >Adolescents presenting with pulmonary symptoms without a history of smoking should raise suspicion for AAT deficiency.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hepatic manifestations</span>
	- Prolonged neonatal jaundice
	- Hepatitis
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">Cirrhosis</mark>
	- Increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
		- Patients with AAT deficiency are at risk of developing liver cirrhosis with subsequent HCC. HCC can also develop in the absence of cirrhosis.

# Diagnostics
- Serum: decreased antitrypsin protein levels
- Electrophoresis: decreased alpha-1 peak  [5]
- Chest x-ray 
	- Low and flat diaphragm
	- Widened intercostal spaces
	- Hyperinflation and increased basilar radiolucency of both lungs with rarification of peripheral pulmonary vessels
- Chest CT [6]
	- Panacinar emphysema (in contrast to centriacinar emphysema in smoking-related emphysema)
	- Bronchiectasis
	- Bullae
- Liver biopsy
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">PAS-positive</span>, spherical inclusion bodies in periportal hepatocytes![[Pasted image 20231029101651.png]]
