# Myeloproliferative neoplasms
Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) were previously referred to as myeloproliferative diseases until 2008 when they were reclassified as cancers.
The difference between MPD and MDS is whether the cells mature normally or abnormally. In <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">myeloproliferative disorders</mark>, cells mature normally, but they have an abnormally high amount of proliferation. In <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">myelodysplastic syndromes</mark>, the cells mature abnormally. A stem cell in the bone marrow, instead of maturing into a normal cell, matures into something else â€“ something just weird, and often not very functional.
