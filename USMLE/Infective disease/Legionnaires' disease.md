- Legionnaires' disease: a type of legionellosis that manifests as [[Pneumonia#Atypical pneumonia]]
- Pontiac fever: a type of legionellosis that manifests with flu-like symptoms without pneumonia.
# Epidemiology
- Manifests almost exclusively in adults
- Locations at increased risk of a legionella outbreak include:
	- Nursing homes
	- Hospitals
	- Confined travel accommodations (e.g., cruise ships, hotels, resorts)
# Clinical features
- Incubation period: 2â€“10 days
- Fever, chills, headache
- Severe atypical pneumonia: dry cough which can become productive, shortness of breath, bilateral crackles
- Relative bradycardia
- Diarrhea
- Neurological features, especially confusion, agitation, and stupor
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Legionnaires' disease should always be considered in patients with signs of atypical pneumonia and diarrhea in combination with possible exposure (e.g., cruise ship travel, use of a whirlpool).</mark>
