# Virulence factors
- Antiphagocytic capsule
	- B. anthracis is the only bacterium that is capable of forming a polypeptide capsule 
	- Contains poly-D-glutamate
  >[!tip] 
>The capsule protects the bacterium from lysis following phagocytosis. B. anthracis is not infectious if not encapsulated.

- Anthrax toxin: responsible for the local and systemic manifestations of anthrax; made up of A and B subunits
	- The A subunit has 2 components:
		- EF (edema factor): binds to calcium and calmodulin and gains adenylate cyclase activity → ↑ cAMP → cell edema
		- LF (lethal factor): a metalloprotease that destroys MAPKK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ) → cell death 
	- The B subunit (PA; anthrax toxin protective antigen) binds to endothelial receptors and facilitates entry of the A subunit into the host cell.
