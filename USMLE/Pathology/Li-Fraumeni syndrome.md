Autosomal dominant mutation of the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">p53 tumor suppressor gene</span>
- Pathophysiology
	- One abnormal copy of the TP53 gene is inherited.
	- If the second allele is somatically mutated or deleted (loss of heterozygosity), it results in unregulated cell proliferation and cancer.
- Clinical features: multiple malignancies at an early age
	- Breast cancer
	- Osteosarcoma
	- Leukemia, lymphoma
	- Brain tumors
	- Adrenocortical carcinoma
