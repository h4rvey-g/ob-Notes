# AL amyloidosis (primary amyloidosis)
Most common form of amyloidosis
## Etiology
Low-level expansion of a plasma cell dyscrasia (e.g., multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia)

---
## Pathophysiology
Increased production of the light chains of immunoglobulins → deposition of amyloid light chain protein (AL protein)

# AA amyloidosis (secondary amyloidosis)
## Etiology
AA amyloidosis is secondary to a chronic disease, such as:
- Chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g., IBD, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, vasculitis, familial Mediterranean fever)
- Chronic infectious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis, [[bronchiectasis]], leprosy, osteomyelitis)

---
## Pathophysiology
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chronic inflammatory process → ↑ production of acute phase reactant SAA (serum amyloid-associated protein) → deposition of AA (amyloid-associated) protein in various organs</span>

---
## Clinical features
- Kidney: [[nephrotic syndrome]]
- Liver and spleen: hepatomegaly, [[splenomegaly]]
>[!tip] 
>The main feature of AA amyloidosis at diagnosis is renal dysfunction (e.g., CKD, [[nephrotic syndrome]]). Cardiac involvement is rare.

---
## Diagnostics
>[!tip] 
>Amyloidosis should always be considered in patients who present with kidney, liver, or GI involvement in the setting of chronic inflammatory and/or infectious disease.
