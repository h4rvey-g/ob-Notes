### QRS complex
- Typically narrow QRS complex (< 0.12 seconds)
- Wide QRS complex may be seen in some situations:
	- Aberrant conduction, e.g., bundle branch block or preexcitation (as seen in Afib with WPW)
	- Complete AV block with a ventricular escape rhythm
	- [[Ashman phenomenon]]: intermittent aberrant ventricular conduction results in isolated or short runs of wide QRS complexes

>[!warning] 
>Wide QRS complex may indicate preexcited Afib or aberrant conduction.
