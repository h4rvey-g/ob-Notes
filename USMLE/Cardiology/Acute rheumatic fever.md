## ECG
- Most common: prolonged PR interval (first-degree AV block)  
- Potential additional findings include:
	- Second-degree AV block 
	- Complete heart block 
	- Sinus tachycardia
	- Accelerated junctional rhythm
	- ECG features of pericarditis

>[!tip] 
>Whenever you see marked <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">left atrial abnormality or [[atrial fibrillation]] in the presence of right ventricular hypertrophy signs</span>, always think about rheumatic mitral valve disease. Mitral stenosis is the only single lesion that can readily account for the combination of left atrial enlargement and right ventricular hypertrophy.
