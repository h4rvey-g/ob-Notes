# Etiology
- Previous infection with group A β-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS), also referred to as [[Streptococcus pyogenes]]
	- Usually acute tonsillitis or pharyngitis (“strep throat”)
	- GAS infections of the skin (e.g., erysipelas, impetigo, cellulitis) tend to be complicated by [[poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis]] rather than rheumatic fever.

# Pathophysiology
- Most commonly accepted mechanism involves the following: acute tonsillitis/pharyngitis caused by GAS without antibiotic treatment → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">development of antibodies against streptococcal M protein → cross-reaction of antibodies with nerve and myocardial proteins (most commonly myosins)</span> due to molecular mimicry → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">type II hypersensitivity reaction</span> → acute inflammatory sequela

>[!Mnemonic] 
>- Major criteria: SPACE
>	- Subcutaneous nodules
>	- Pancarditis
>	- Arthritis (Polyarthritis; for moderate to high-risk population – monoarthritis also qualifies)
>	- Chorea
>	- Erythema marginatum
>
>- Minor criteria: LEAF
>	- Long PR interval
>	- ESR ≥ 60mm/hr (or ≥ 30mm/hr in moderate to high-risk population) and CRP ≥ 3mg/dl
>	- Arthralgia (Polyarthralgia; for moderate to high-risk population – monoarthralgia also qualifies)
>	- Fever ( ≥ 38.5c; ≥ 38c for moderate to high-risk population )

## ECG
- Most common: prolonged PR interval (first-degree AV block)  
- Potential additional findings include:
	- Second-degree AV block 
	- Complete heart block 
	- Sinus tachycardia
	- Accelerated junctional rhythm
	- ECG features of pericarditis

>[!tip] 
>Whenever you see marked <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">left atrial abnormality or [[atrial fibrillation]] in the presence of right ventricular hypertrophy signs</span>, always think about rheumatic mitral valve disease. Mitral stenosis is the only single lesion that can readily account for the combination of left atrial enlargement and right ventricular hypertrophy.
