# Diagnostics
- Narrow complex tachycardia
- Regular atrial activity at ~300 bpm
- Loss of the isoelectric baseline
- “Saw-tooth” pattern of **inverted flutter** waves in leads II, III, aVF
	- **_Anticlockwise Reentry:_** Commonest form of atrial flutter (90% of cases). Retrograde atrial conduction produces
		- Inverted flutter waves in leads II,III, aVF
		- Positive flutter waves in V1 — may resemble upright P waves
- Upright flutter waves in V1 that may resemble P waves
- Ventricular rate depends on AV conduction ratio (see below)
