A group of diuretic agents that act as Na⁺-Cl⁻ cotransporter inhibitors in the early distal renal tubule. Used mainly to treat hypertension. Examples include hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone. Adverse effects include metabolic alkalosis, electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, [[hypercalcemia]]), metabolic effects (hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia), and sulfonamide hypersensitivity.
