# WPW syndrome
WPW syndrome is a specific form of pre-excitation syndrome characterized by a <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">congenital</mark> accessory pathway and tachyarrhythmias, while pre-excitation syndrome is a broader term that encompasses various syndromes involving early ventricular activation.a
## ECG
- PR interval < 120ms
- [Delta wave](https://litfl.com/delta-wave-ecg-library/): slurring slow rise of initial portion of the QRS
	- The Delta wave is a slurred upstroke in the QRS complex.![[Pasted image 20230819222341.png]]
- QRS prolongation > 110ms
- Discordant ST-segment and T-wave changes (i.e. in the opposite direction to the major component of the QRS complex)
- Pseudo-infarction pattern in up to 70% of patients — due to negatively deflected delta waves in inferior/anterior leads (“pseudo-Q waves”), or prominent R waves in V1-3 (mimicking posterior infarction)![[Pasted image 20230819222745.png]]
# AVNRT
[P wave](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/pl0LBT#Z322a8570694c6bce37349457185e57ec) is typically not visible (it falls in or is "buried" in the [QRS complex](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/pl0LBT#Zb6a46f472e496e639cee60c43bd0acbd))
[[Vagal maneuver]] is the first step to treat AVNRT.
# SVT vs Sinus tachycardia
The real difference is the rate, practically.
SVT is generally 150 and above. Sinus tach is 100-150.
