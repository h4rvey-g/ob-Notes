 Rheumatic heart disease can affect people of all ages, but it is more common in children and young adults, especially between the ages of 5 and 15 years old. However, it can also develop in adults who have had rheumatic fever as children. The risk of developing rheumatic heart disease is higher in people who have had repeated episodes of rheumatic fever.
