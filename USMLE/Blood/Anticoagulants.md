# Physiologic anticoagulants
- Inhibit intrinsic pathway: 
	- Antithrombin (with heparin): inhibit factor 2(thrombin), 9, 10, 11, 12
	- Protein C: inhibit 5, 8; need VitK to synthesize
- Inhibit extrinsic pathway:
	- TFPI(Tissue factor pathway inhibitor): combine factor 10 to inhibit factor 8
# Oral anticoagulants

>[!tip] 
>- Heparin: also affects VIII and IX -> intrinsic pathway -> PTT
>- Warfarin: affects both intrinsic and extrinsic pathway, but VII has shorter half life -> extrinsic pathway -> PT
>	- The half-lives of the procoagulants are ∼ 2–4 days (except for factor VII, which has a short half-life), while the anticoagulants only have half-lives of 6–10 hours.
>	- Intrinsic pathway remains active another 2–3 days, while extrinsic pathway and protein C are already inactive.
