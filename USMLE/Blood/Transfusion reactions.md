# Anaphylactic [[transfusion]] reaction
- Pathophysiology
	- [[Type I hypersensitivity reaction]] in which <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">preformed IgE antibodies on the surface of mast cells bind to donor plasma proteins (commonly donor IgA in recipients with IgA deficiency)</span>, leading to mast cell degranulation
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Individuals with IgA deficiency should receive IgA-depleted blood products.</span>
- Clinical features: Sudden onset during or up to 3 hours after the transfusion
	- Shock, hypotension, wheezing, respiratory distress
	- Skin reactions (e.g., pruritus, urticaria)
