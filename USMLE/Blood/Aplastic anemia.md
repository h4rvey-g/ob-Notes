- Description
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pancytopenia caused by bone marrow insufficiency </span>
	- Should not be confused with aplastic crisis, a condition in which erythropoiesis is temporarily suppressed (e.g., due to parvovirus B19 infection in patients with hemolytic anemias)
- Etiology
	- Idiopathic in > 50% of cases
		- Possibly immune-mediated
		- May follow acute hepatitis (hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia)
	- Medication side effects: carbamazepine, methimazole, NSAIDs, chloramphenicol, propylthiouracil, sulfa drugs, cytostatic drugs (esp. alkylating agents and antimetabolites) 
	- Toxins: benzene, cleaning solvents, insecticides, toluene
	- Ionizing radiation
	- Viruses: HBV, EBV, CMV, HIV

		- Hereditary autosomal recessive disorder due to a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">DNA crosslink repair defect resulting in bone marrow failure</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Skeletal and organ abnormalities: short stature, hypo- and hyperpigmentation, cafe-au-lait spots, microcephaly, developmental delay, thumb and forearm malformations, kidney, GI, heart, eye, and ear abnormalities</span>
		- Laboratory tests show <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">pancytopenia and normocytic or macrocytic anemia.</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">âˆ¼ 50% of patients with Fanconi anemia will develop [[Acute leukemia|acute myeloid leukemia]] or [[myelodysplastic syndromes]] in early adulthood.</span>
