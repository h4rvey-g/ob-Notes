>[!Mnemonic] 
>- Mnemo I use for Doxorubicin /Daunorubicin:
> 	- They both end in -rubicin -> ruby (= red) -> the heart is red -> cardiotoxicity
> 	- Dilated cardiomyopathy because it starts with D like Doxorubicin
> 	- Dexrazoxane used to prevent it -> also starts with D and sounds like Roxane ('Roxane, you don't have to put on the red light', song by the police) -> again red for RUBYcin and heart
> - Bleomycin: **b**leo -> fi**b**ro
