A group of enzymes found throughout the body but produced predominantly in the liver, bones, placenta, and small intestine. Common causes of elevated serum ALP include cholestasis, bone disease (e.g., <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">bone metastases</mark>, [[Paget disease|Paget's disease]], [[hyperparathyroidism]]), and pregnancy. The normal reference range is 40-120 U/L.
# Common causes of elevation
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cholestasis (obstructive or nonobstructive)</span>
	- When ALP is elevated but Î³-GT and AST/ALT ratio are normal, cholestasis is an unlikely cause for the ALP elevation.
- Infiltrative diseases of the liver (e.g., malignancies or [[amyloidosis]])
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased osteoblast activity </span>
	- E.g., skeletal metastases, osteomalacia, fracture healing, [[Paget disease]], and during physiological growth periods
- Seminoma
- Pregnancy (third trimester)
- Chronic kidney disease
# Differential Diagnosis Based on Elevated LFTs

## Hepatocellular pattern: Elevated aminotransferases out of proportion to alkaline phosphatase

- **ALT-predominant**:  Acute or chronic viral hepatitis, steatohepatitis, acute Budd-Chiari syndrome, ischemic hepatitis, autoimmune, [[hemochromatosis]], medications/toxins, autoimmune, alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, [[Wilson disease]], [[Celiac disease]]
- **AST-predominant**: Alcohol-related, steatohepatitis, [[cirrhosis]], non-hepatic (hemolysis, myopathy, thyroid disease, exercise)
## Cholestatic pattern: Elevated alkaline phosphatase +gamma glutamyl transferase + bilirubin out of proportion to AST and ALT

- **Hepatobiliary causes**: Bile duct obstruction, [[Primary biliary cholangitis|primary biliary cirrhosis]], [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]], medication-induced, infiltrating diseases of the liver ([[sarcoidosis]], [[amyloidosis]], lymphoma, among others), [[cystic fibrosis]], hepatic metastasis, cholestasis
- **Non-Hepatic causes**: Bone disease, pregnancy, chronic renal failure, lymphoma or other malignancies, [[congestive heart failure]], childhood growth, infection, or inflammation

>The mechanism for an elevated alkaline phosphatase has been related to enhanced synthesis and to release from cell membranes by the detergent action of retained bile salts.
