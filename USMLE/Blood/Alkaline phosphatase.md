A group of enzymes found throughout the body but produced predominantly in the liver, bones, placenta, and small intestine. Common causes of elevated serum ALP include cholestasis, bone disease (e.g., <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">bone metastases</mark>, Paget's disease, [[hyperparathyroidism]]), and pregnancy. The normal reference range is 20–70 U/L.
# Common causes of elevation
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cholestasis (obstructive or nonobstructive)</span>
	- When ALP is elevated but γ-GT and AST/ALT ratio are normal, cholestasis is an unlikely cause for the ALP elevation.
- Infiltrative diseases of the liver (e.g., malignancies or [[amyloidosis]])
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased osteoblast activity </span>
	- E.g., skeletal metastases, osteomalacia, fracture healing, Paget disease, and during physiological growth periods
- Seminoma
- Pregnancy (third trimester)
- Chronic kidney disease
