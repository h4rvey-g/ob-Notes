# Epidemiology
- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
	- Peak incidence: 2–5 years
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common malignant disease in children</span>
	- ∼ 80% of acute leukemias during childhood are lymphoblastic.

# Etiology
## Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
- Genetic or chromosomal factors
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Down syndrome]]: Risk of ALL is, like that of AML, 10–20 times higher in patients with [[Down syndrome]] compared to the general population.</span>
	- Neurofibromatosis type 1
	- Ataxia telangiectasia

>[!tip] 
>Some subtypes (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">especially M3, or APL</span>) exhibit Auer rods 
>- Pink-red, rod-shaped granular cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in malignant immature myeloblasts or promyelocytes
>- Myeloperoxidase (MPO) positive
