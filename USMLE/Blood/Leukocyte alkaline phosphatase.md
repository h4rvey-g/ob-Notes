An enzyme found in mature leukocytes. Staining of LAP on peripheral blood smear is used to calculate the LAP score. <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">A high LAP score is associated with an increased number of mature white blood cells (e.g., from leukemoid reaction or myeloproliferative disorders); a low LAP score is associated with an increased number of immature white blood cells (e.g., from CML).</mark>

Differ from [[Alkaline phosphatase]].
