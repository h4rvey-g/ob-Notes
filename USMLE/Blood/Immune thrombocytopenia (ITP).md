# Etiology
- Primary ITP: idiopathic (most common)  [6]
- Secondary ITP associated with:
	- Autoimmune disorders: SLE, [[antiphospholipid syndrome]]
	- Malignancy: lymphoma, leukemia (particularly CLL)
	- Infection: HIV, HCV
	- Drugs: e.g., quinine, beta-lactam antibiotics, carbamazepine, heparin, vaccines, linezolid, sulfonamides, vancomycin, TMP-SMX, antiepileptics  [7]

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">The acute form is typically seen in children after a viral disease.</mark>
# Pathophysiology
Antiplatelet antibodies (mostly IgG directed against, e.g., GpIIb/IIIa, GpIb/IX) bind to surface proteins on platelets → <mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;">sequestration by spleen and liver</mark> → ↓ platelet count → bone marrow megakaryocytes and platelet production increase in response (in most cases).
# Clinical features
Mostly asymptomatic.<mark style="background: #FFF3A34A;"> [[Splenomegaly]] is very unusual in ITP and makes other diagnoses more likely! </mark>
