# VitB12 deficiency
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">In neurologic symptoms caused by vitamin B12 deficiency, both homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels are increased.</mark> Measurement of these metabolites has been shown to be more sensitive in diagnosing vitamin B12 deficiency than measuring serum B12 levels alone [3]. Elevated methylmalonic acid levels indicate a deficiency in vitamin B12, as <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">methylmalonic acid reacts with vitamin B12 to produce coenzyme A, which is essential for normal cellular function</mark> [4]. Homocysteine levels also increase due to vitamin B12 deficiency, as <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">vitamin B12 is necessary for the metabolism of homocysteine [4].</mark> These metabolites can serve as early markers for tissue vitamin B12 deficiency, even before hematologic manifestations occur [3].
