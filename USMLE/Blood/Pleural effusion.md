## Light criteria
![[Pasted image 20230727145202.png]]
>[!tip] 
>- Total protein normal level **6.0 to 8.3 g/dL** (60 to 83 g/L)
>- Albumin normal level **3.4 to 5.4 g/dL** (34 to 54 g/L)
>- LDH normal level **105 to 333 U/L**

Satisfying any ONE criterium means it is exudative:
- Pleural Total Protein/Serum Total Protein ratio > 0.5
- Pleural lactate dehydrogenase/Serum lactate dehydrogenase ratio > 0.6
- Pleural lactate dehydrogenase level > 2/3 upper limit of the laboratory's reference range of serum lactate dehydrogenase.
