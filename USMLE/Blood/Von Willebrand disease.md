**Mixed platelet and coagulation disorders**
# Epidemiology
Most common congenital bleeding disorder.
# Pathophysiology
Deficiency or dysfunction of vWF leads to:
- Dysfunctional platelet adhesion → impaired primary hemostasis
- Reduced binding of factor VIII → increased degradation → ↓ factor VIII activity → impaired intrinsic pathway of secondary hemostasis
