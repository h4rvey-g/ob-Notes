**Mixed platelet and coagulation disorders**
# Epidemiology
Most common congenital bleeding disorder.
# Pathophysiology
Deficiency or dysfunction of vWF leads to:
- Dysfunctional platelet adhesion → impaired primary hemostasis
- Reduced binding of factor VIII → increased degradation → ↓ factor VIII activity → impaired intrinsic pathway of secondary hemostasis
Ristocetin cofactor assay: measures the ability of von Willebrand factor (vWF) to agglutinate platelets.
- Ristocetin: antibiotic that activates vWF, which then binds to glycoprotein Ib on platelets 
- Interpretation: If ristocetin is added to blood lacking vWF (or the vWF receptor), platelets will not aggregate.
