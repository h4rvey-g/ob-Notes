Why platelets must be stored in room temperature?
1. Cold storage can activate platelets: Cold storage of platelets at temperatures below room temperature (15 °C) can induce platelet activation, resulting in changes in platelet shape and functionality [[0]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2897204/). This activation can lead to platelet aggregation and a decrease in platelet viability, making the stored platelets less effective for transfusion purposes.
2. Platelet clearance from circulation: Platelets stored at refrigerating temperatures are rapidly cleared from the bloodstream when transfused, reducing their effectiveness [[7]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16232387/). Cold storage can cause clustering of glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) receptors on the platelet surface, which exposes beta-N-acetylglucosamine residues. These exposed residues are recognized by liver macrophages, leading to rapid clearance of the platelets through phagocytosis. This clearance mechanism limits the viability and availability of cold-stored platelets
