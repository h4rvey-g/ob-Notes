# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
severe malnutrition (e.g., due to alcoholism, illicit drug use, and/or psychiatric illness)

---
# Pathophysiology
## Vitamin C functions
- Hydrophilic antioxidant
- Conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine: coenzyme in dopamine β-hydroxylase
- [[Collagen]] synthesis: coenzyme in hydroxylation reaction of proline and lysine
- Facilitates iron [[absorption]] (keeps iron in Fe2+reduced state)

---
# Clinical features
- Scurvy: clinical manifestation of vitamin C deficiency, which leads to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impaired [[collagen]] synthesis and easily damaged connective tissue</span>
	- Follicular hyperkeratosis, perifollicular hemorrhage, coiled “corkscrew” hair 
	- Subperiosteal hemorrhage
	- Gingivitis, swollen gums
	- Mucosal bleeding, easy bruising, petechiae
	- Impaired wound healing
	- Arthralgia, hemarthrosis
	- Signs of anemia (fatigue, paleness)  [21]
		- Normocytic anemia: decreased iron absorption in the small intestine
		- Macrocytic anemia: decreased conversion of folate into its active metabolite
- Poor immune response

# Vitamin C toxicity
- Nausea, vomiting
- Diarrhea, bloating
- Fatigue

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Nephrolithiasis]] due to ↑ calcium oxalate formation</span>
	- excess oxalate from vitamin C metabolism
