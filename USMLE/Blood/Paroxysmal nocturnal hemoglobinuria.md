An acquired genetic defect of the hematopoietic stem cell characterized by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">a triad of hemolytic [[anemia]], pancytopenia, and thrombosis</span>
# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology


---
# Pathophysiology
- Physiologically, a membrane-bound glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor protects RBCs against complement-mediated hemolysis.
- Acquired mutation on the PIGA gene located on the X chromosome → GPI anchor loses its protective effect → RBC destruction by complement and reticuloendothelial system → intravascular and extravascular hemolysis
- PNH can also occur in patients with aplastic [[anemia]] and MDS.

# Clinical features
- Pallor, excessive fatigue, weakness
- Intermittent jaundice
- Episodes of hemoglobinuria causing pink/red/dark urine which usually occurs in the morning due to the concentration of urine overnight.
- Vasoconstriction  [9]
	- Headache, pulmonary hypertension
	- Abdominal pain, dysphagia, erectile dysfunction
- Venous thrombosis in unusual locations (e.g., hepatic, cerebral, and/or abdominal veins)  [4]
- Increased risk of infections (in case of pancytopenia)
