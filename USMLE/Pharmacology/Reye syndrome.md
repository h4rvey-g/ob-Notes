- Description: a rare type of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hepatic encephalopathy</span> that is associated with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">aspirin use for viral illness in children</span> < 19 years 
- Etiology: aspirin use in individuals < 19 years of age with a febrile illness  [14][15]
- Pathophysiology [16]
	- Viruses alter the metabolism of salicylates  → accumulation of salicylate metabolites in the liver → mitochondrial injury and reversible inhibition of enzymes required for fatty acid oxidation → failure of hepatic ATP production → acute hepatic failure → hyperammonemia, metabolic acidosis, and hepatic steatosis → acute encephalopathy
	- Hyperammonemia → cerebral edema → ↑ ICP
