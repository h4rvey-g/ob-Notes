# Basic metabolic panel
![[Pasted image 20230813153046.png]]
## BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)
The basic metabolic panel also assesses renal function, which includes a BUN and creatinine. 
The normal range for BUN is about 5-20 mg/dL.

The Trick:
Use the word “bun” to think of bunion. 
Bunions are typically located on the toes or digits, and we have 5 digits per extremity which totals 20 digits. 
This will help you remember the normal range for BUN is 5-20 mg/dL.
