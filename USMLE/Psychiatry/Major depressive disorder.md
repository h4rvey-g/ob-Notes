## Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)
- Clinical features: Unlike in MDD, thoughts of suicide, loss of interest, and psychomotor agitation or retardation are not typical features of persistent depressive disorder; therefore, dysthymia is often regarded as a milder form of MDD.
- Diagnostic criteria
	- Depressed mood in addition to ≥ 2 of the clinical features mentioned above
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The symptoms are present for most of the day, and for the majority of days, for ≥ 2 years in adults.</span>
