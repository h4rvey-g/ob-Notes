	- Located in the grey matter of the brain
	- Aβ protein is the main component of the plaques.

	- ↑ Phosphorylation (hyperphosphorylation) of tau → formation of intracellular fibrils → neurotoxic effect (number of tangles correlates with the degree of cognitive impairment)
- Reduced cholinergic function

# Pathology
## Macroscopic
- Cerebral atrophy
	- Damage to the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex (medial temporal lobe structures) is the earliest gross pathological change.
	- Degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert
	- Diffuse cortical atrophy occurs as the disease progresses.
## Microscopic

	- Cerebral amyloid angiopathy
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Multiple large red-brown extracellular senile plaques (beta-amyloid core) in gray matter</span>![[Pasted image 20231225220038.png]]

- Hirano bodies
	- Intracellular rod-shaped eosinophilic aggregates of actin and actin-associated proteins in neurons, especially in hippocampus
