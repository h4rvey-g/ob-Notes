# Pathology
## Macroscopic
- Cerebral atrophy
	- Damage to the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex (medial temporal lobe structures) is the earliest gross pathological change.
	- Degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert
	- Diffuse cortical atrophy occurs as the disease progresses.
