# Clinical features
## Cognitive
- Common symptoms of cognitive impairment
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Short-term memory impairment</span>
		- Insidious onset
		- Slow progression
		- Episodic memory affected first
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Language impairment </span>
		- Typical sequence: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impaired naming, followed by impaired comprehension and impaired fluency</span>
	- Temporal and spatial disorientation (patients are usually not oriented to person, place, time, or events) 
	- Impairment of executive functions and judgment
- Less common symptoms
	- Primary progressive aphasia 
	- Apraxia
## Noncognitive
- Behavioral changes
	- Apathy
	- Agitation, aggression, irritability
- Mood disorders (e.g., symptoms of depression)
- [[Urinary incontinence]]

# Diagnostics
## MRI brain
- Indication: all patients as part of the initial evaluation of major neurocognitive disorder
- Supportive findings
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Signs of generalized or focal cerebral atrophy </span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Enlarged ventricles (ventriculomegaly)</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Narrowing of gyri</span>
		- Prominent cerebral sulci (hydrocephalus ex vacuo)
	- Disproportionate atrophy of the medial temporal lobe including the hippocampi, amygdala, cingulate cortex, and parahippocampal gyrus

![[Pasted image 20240101141930.png]]![[Pasted image 20240101141939.png]]There is bilateral cerebral atrophy, with prominent sulci (green overlay). Multiple small hyperintense foci in the white matter (examples outlined) are enlarged perivascular spaces (Virchow-Robin spaces).
# Pathology
## Macroscopic
- Cerebral atrophy
	- Damage to the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex (medial temporal lobe structures) is the earliest gross pathological change.
	- Degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert
	- Diffuse cortical atrophy occurs as the disease progresses.
## Microscopic
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Amyloid beta (Aβ): stains with Congo red under polarization</span>
	- Cerebral amyloid angiopathy
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Multiple large red-brown extracellular senile plaques (beta-amyloid core) in gray matter</span>![[Pasted image 20231225220038.png]]

- Hirano bodies
	- Intracellular rod-shaped eosinophilic aggregates of actin and actin-associated proteins in neurons, especially in hippocampus

# Treatment
## Pharmacological treatment
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs)</span>
	- Reversible cholinesterase inhibition → ↑ ACh concentration at the synaptic gap
