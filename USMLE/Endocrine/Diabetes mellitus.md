# Clinical features
## Onset
### Type 1 DM
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Often sudden</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)</span> is the first manifestation in approx. one-third of cases.
### Type 2 DM
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Typically gradual</span>
- The majority of patients are asymptomatic. 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Some patients may present with a hyperglycemic crisis.</span>
	- Elderly patients especially may present in a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
	- Occasionally, patients with T2DM present with DKA , which mostly affects black and Hispanic individuals.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Symptoms of complications may be the first clinical sign of disease.</span>
## Common clinical features
- Classic symptoms of hyperglycemia
	- Polyuria, which can lead to secondary enuresis and nocturia in children 
	- Polydipsia 
	- Polyphagia
- Nonspecific symptoms
	- Unexplained weight loss
	- Visual disturbances, e.g., blurred vision 
	- Fatigue
## Specific clinical features
### Type 2 DM
- Possible cutaneous signs of insulin resistance 
	- Benign [[acanthosis nigricans]] ![[Pasted image 20231204112121.png]]
	- Acrochordons![[Pasted image 20231204112802.png]]
# Complications
## Microvascular disease
- Onset: typically arises 5–10 years after onset of disease
- Pathophysiology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">chronic hyperglycemia → nonenzymatic glycation of proteins and lipids → thickening of the basal membrane with progressive function impairment and tissue damage</span>
- Manifestations
	- [[Diabetic kidney disease|Diabetic nephropathy]]
	- Diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma
	- [[Diabetic neuropathy]] including [[diabetic gastroparesis]]
	- Diabetic foot

# Treatment
## T1DM
- Insulin![[Pasted image 20231209112442.png]]
## T2DM
- Metformin![[Pasted image 20231209113337.png]]
