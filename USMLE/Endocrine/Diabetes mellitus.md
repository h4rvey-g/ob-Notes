# Pathophysiology
## Normal insulin physiology
- Secretion: Insulin is synthesized in the β cells of the islets of Langerhans. The <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">cleavage of proinsulin (precursor molecule of insulin)</span> produces C-peptide (connecting peptide) and insulin, which consists of two peptide chains (A and B chains).
## Type 2 diabetes
- Mechanisms
	- Peripheral insulin resistance
		- Numerous genetic and environmental factors
			- Central obesity → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased plasma levels of free fatty acids → impaired insulin-dependent glucose uptake</span> into hepatocytes, myocytes, and adipocytes 
			- Increased serine kinase activity in fat and skeletal muscle cells → phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 → decreased affinity of IRS-1 for PI3K → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decreased expression of GLUT4 channels → decreased cellular glucose uptake</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pancreatic β cell dysfunction: accumulation of pro-amylin (islet amyloid polypeptide) in the pancreas  → decreased endogenous insulin production</span>
- Progression
	- Initially, insulin resistance is compensated by increased insulin and amylin secretion. 
	- Over the course of the disease, insulin resistance progresses, while insulin secretion capacity declines.
	- After a period of impaired glucose tolerance with isolated postprandial hyperglycemia, diabetes manifests with [[Metabolic fuel use|fasting]] hyperglycemia.

# Clinical features
## Onset
### Type 1 DM
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Often sudden</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)</span> is the first manifestation in approx. one-third of cases.
### Type 2 DM
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Typically gradual</span>
- The majority of patients are asymptomatic. 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Some patients may present with a hyperglycemic crisis.</span>
	- Elderly patients especially may present in a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
	- Occasionally, patients with T2DM present with DKA , which mostly affects black and Hispanic individuals.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Symptoms of complications may be the first clinical sign of disease.</span>
## Common clinical features
- Classic symptoms of hyperglycemia
	- Polyuria, which can lead to secondary enuresis and nocturia in children 
	- Polydipsia 
	- Polyphagia
- Nonspecific symptoms
	- Unexplained weight loss
	- Visual disturbances, e.g., blurred vision 
	- Fatigue
## Specific clinical features
### Type 2 DM
- Possible cutaneous signs of insulin resistance 
	- Benign [[acanthosis nigricans]] ![[Pasted image 20231204112121.png]]
	- Acrochordons![[Pasted image 20231204112802.png]]
# Complications
## Microvascular disease
- Onset: typically arises 5–10 years after onset of disease
- Pathophysiology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">chronic hyperglycemia → nonenzymatic glycation of proteins and lipids → thickening of the basal membrane with progressive function impairment and tissue damage</span>
- Manifestations
	- [[Diabetic kidney disease|Diabetic nephropathy]]
	- Diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma
	- [[Diabetic neuropathy]] including [[diabetic gastroparesis]]
	- Diabetic foot

>[!tip] 
>Strict glycemic control is crucial in preventing microvascular disease.

## T1DM

## T2DM

>[!Mnemonic] 
><font color="#ffc000">Met</font>formin accumulation will cause <font color="#ffc000">met</font>abolic acidosis (lactic acidosis), so stop it before contrast CT scan.
- Sulfonylureas
	- Close K+ channels in pancreatic B cell membrane → cell depolarizes → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">insulin release via ↑ Ca2+ influx.</span>![[Pasted image 20231209134835.png]]

>[!Mnemonic] 
>G (Gee), IDE take your sulfonylurea.
>The G is because all sulfonylureas start with G. 
>This helps to separate the sulfonylureas from the meglitinides since they also end with IDE

	- Mechanism of action: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">activation of the transcription factor PPARγ</span> (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor of gamma type in the nucleus) → ↑ transcription of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism → ↑ levels of adipokines such as adiponectin and insulin sensitivity → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ storage of fatty acids in adipocytes</span>, ↓ products of lipid metabolism (e.g., free fatty acids) → ↓ free fatty acids in circulation → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ glucose utilization and ↓ hepatic glucose productio</span>n
	- Clinical characteristics
		- Glycemic efficacy: lowers HbA1c by 1% in 3 months
		- Favorable effect on lipid metabolism: ↓ triglyceride, ↓ LDL, ↑ HDL
		- No risk of hypoglycemia
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Onset of action is delayed by several weeks. </span>
			- because it acts at the level of transcription
	- Important side effects
