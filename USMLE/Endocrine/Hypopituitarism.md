# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sheehan syndrome: postpartum necrosis of the pituitary gland. Usually occurs following postpartum hemorrhage</span>, but can also occur even without clinical evidence of hemorrhage.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">During pregnancy, hypertrophy of prolactin-producing regions increases the size of the pituitary gland, making it very sensitive to ischemia.</span>
	- Blood loss during delivery/postpartum hemorrhage → hypovolemia → vasospasm of hypophyseal vessels → ischemia of the pituitary gland → empty sella turcica on imaging
