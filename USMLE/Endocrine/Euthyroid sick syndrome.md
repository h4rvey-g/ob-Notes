A syndrome that causes abnormal findings on thyroid function tests in patients with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">severe, nonthyroidal illness (e.g., a critically ill intensive care patient)</span>. Believed to be caused by cytokines. The most common pattern is a decrease in T3 levels, while levels of T4 and TSH are normal or low (low T3 syndrome).
