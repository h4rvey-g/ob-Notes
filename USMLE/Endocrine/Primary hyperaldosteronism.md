# Treatment
- Unilateral disease or adrenal carcinoma: surgery preferred
- Bilateral disease: medical management preferred
	- Bilateral adrenalectomy has a low success rate for curing hypertension and also leaves the patient dependent on lifelong glucocorticoid replacement; for this reason, medical management is recommended for bilateral disease.
## Medical management
- First-line: aldosterone receptor antagonists
	- Spironolactone (preferred) 
	- Eplerenone
		- In contrast to spironolactone, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">eplerenone does not block androgen or progesterone receptors, which decreases certain side effects</span> (e.g., gynecomastia and decreased libido); <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">however, eplerenone is only half as potent</span> at blocking the mineralocorticoid receptor and is less effective at lowering blood pressure.
