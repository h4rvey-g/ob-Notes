# Pathophysiology
- Carcinoid tumors can synthesize different hormones (most commonly serotonin).
- Serotonin is degraded via the following mechanisms:
	- First-pass metabolism in the liver
	- Monoamine oxidases in the lung
- Serotonin can reach systemic circulation under the following conditions:
	- Intestinal carcinoid tumors with liver metastases 
	- Extraintestinal carcinoid tumors 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Serotonin in systemic circulation</span> can lead to:
	- Carcinoid syndrome
	- Carcinoid heart disease
	- Pellagra due to increased serotonin metabolism

# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Carcinoid syndrome</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Diarrhea and abdominal cramps</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cutaneous flushing </span>
		- Caused by vasodilation of small arteries and arterioles
		- Possible triggers: alcohol consumption, food intake, stress
		- In severe cases, may be accompanied by tachycardia and fluctuating blood pressure
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dyspnea, wheezing (asthma-like attacks)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Palpitations</span>
	- Possible weight loss despite normal appetite
- Carcinoid heart disease
	- Liver metastases of the carcinoid tumor produce serotonin which travels to the right heart via the IVC.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Endocardial fibrosis that especially affects the right heart </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tricuspid insufficiency and/or pulmonary stenosis</span>
	- Symptoms of right-sided heart failure
- Other symptoms: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">abdominal pain</span>

>[!tip] 
>In a patient presenting with secretory diarrhea, episodic flushing, wheezing, and cardiac valvular abnormalities, consider a carcinoid tumor.

# Diagnostics
- ↑ 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in 24-hour urine collection
	- A degradation product of serotonin metabolism. Elevated levels in 24-hour urine are seen in carcinoid tumor.

---
# Treatment
- Somatostatin analogs (e.g., octreotide) to relieve symptoms
	- ↓ 5-HIAA levels in the urine
	- High-dose treatment slows progression and increases survival time
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitors (e.g., telotristat)</span> as adjunctive therapy if diarrhea is not controlled with somatostatin analogs
	- rate-limiting step of serotonin synthesis
