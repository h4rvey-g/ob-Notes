# Definition
- Thyrotoxicosis: a hypermetabolic condition caused by an inappropriately high level of circulating thyroid hormones irrespective of the source. 
- Hyperthyroidism: a condition characterized by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">the overproduction of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland</span>; can cause thyrotoxicosis
	- Overt hyperthyroidism
		- ↓ Serum TSH levels with ↑ serum free T4 and/or T3 levels
		- Patients typically experience symptoms of thyrotoxicosis.
		- E.g., [[Graves disease]], toxic MNG, and toxic adenoma
	- Subclinical hyperthyroidism
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Serum TSH levels with normal serum free T4 and T3 levels</span>
		- Patients are normally asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic.
		- May progress to overt hyperthyroidism
		- If the negative feedback regulation mechanism is intact, increased T3 and T4 lead to TSH suppression, which in turn leads to reduced stimulation of thyroid follicular cells. Thyroid hormone levels may then be normal.

- Subacute thyroiditis: The inflammatory disruption of the follicle membranes inhibits the transport of iodine across the thyroid cells.
