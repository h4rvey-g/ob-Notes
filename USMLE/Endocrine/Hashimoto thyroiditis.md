# Epidemiology
- Hashimoto disease is the most common form of thyroiditis and the most frequent cause of hypothyroidism in the US.
- Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide.
- Sex: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">♀ > ♂ (7:1)</span>
- Age of onset: occurs in all age groups; <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">most prevalent in women aged 30–50 years</span>

# Etiology


---
# Pathophysiology
- Associations with HLA-DR3, and DR5 have been proposed.
- Cellular (especially T cells) and humoral immune responses are activated  → active <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">B lymphocytes produce thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs) → destruction of thyroid tissue</span>

# Clinical features
- Early-stage
	- Primarily asymptomatic
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Goiter: nontender or painless</span>, rubbery thyroid with moderate and symmetrical enlargement [2]
	- Hashitoxicosis may occur: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">transient thyrotoxicosis</span> due to follicular rupture of hormone-containing thyroid tissue that manifests with signs of [[hyperthyroidism]] (e.g., irritability, heat intolerance, diarrhea)
- Late-stage
	- Thyroid may be normal-sized or small if extensive fibrosis has occurred.
	- Signs of hypothyroidism (e.g., cold intolerance, constipation, fatigue)
