# Etiology
## Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Autoimmune adrenalitis</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common cause in the US</span> (∼ 80–90% of all cases of primary adrenal insufficiency)
	- Caused by autoimmune destruction of both adrenal cortices
	- Associated with other autoimmune endocrinopathies
- Infectious adrenalitis
	- Tuberculosis: most common cause worldwide, but rare in the US
	- CMV disease in immunosuppressed states (especially AIDS)
	- Histoplasmosis
- Adrenal hemorrhage 
	- Sepsis: especially meningococcal sepsis (endotoxic shock) → hemorrhagic necrosis (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome)
	- Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
- Infiltration of the adrenal glands
	- Tumors (adrenocortical tumors, lymphomas, metastatic carcinoma)
	- Amyloidosis
	- Hemochromatosis
- Adrenalectomy
- Impaired activity of enzymes that are responsible for cortisol synthesis
	- Cortisol synthesis inhibitors (e.g., rifampin, fluconazole, phenytoin, ketoconazole): drug-induced adrenal insufficiency
	- 21β-hydroxylase deficiency
## Tertiary adrenal insufficiency
Tertiary adrenal insufficiency is caused by conditions that <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decrease CRH production.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The most common cause is sudden discontinuation of chronic glucocorticoid therapy.</span>
- Rarer causes include hypothalamic dysfunction (e.g., due to trauma, mass, hemorrhage, or anorexia): ↓ CRH → ↓ ACTH → ↓ cortisol release

# Clinical features
## Hypocortisolism
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Weight loss</span>, anorexia
- Fatigue, lethargy, depression
- Muscle aches
- Weakness
- Gastrointestinal complaints (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)
- Sugar cravings
- (Orthostatic) hypotension
	- Glucocorticoids play an important role in catecholamine‑induced vasoconstriction and myocardial contractility.
### Lab findings
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypoglycemia </span>
	- Glucocorticoids inhibit peripheral glucose utilization and increase [[gluconeogenesis]].
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hyponatremia</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Glucocorticoids inhibit ADH secretion and thereby prevent excessive water retention. With adrenal insufficiency, ADH secretion is disinhibited causing increased reabsorption of free water with subsequent dilution hyponatremia.</span>
## <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypoandrogenism</span>
- Loss of libido
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Loss of axillary and pubic hair</span>
### Lab findings
- ↓ DHEA-S
## Elevated ACTH
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hyperpigmentation of areas that are not normally exposed to sunlight (e.g., palmar creases, mucous membrane of the oral cavity)</span> → tanned skin![[Pasted image 20231222100938.png]]
	- caused by increased production of MSH, which is cleaved from the same precursor peptide (POMC) as ACTH.

# Adrenal crisis
Adrenal crisis is an <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">acute, severe glucocorticoid deficiency that requires immediate emergency treatment.</span>
## Precipitating factors for adrenal crisis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Stress in patients with underlying adrenal insufficiency</span> e.g.:
	- Gastrointestinal illness (most common)
	- Other infections
	- Perioperative period
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sudden discontinuation of glucocorticoids</span> after prolonged glucocorticoid therapy 
- Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage or infarction (e.g., Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome)
- Pituitary apoplexy
>[!tip] 
>In order to prevent the development of secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency, prolonged steroid therapy should be tapered slowly rather than stopped abruptly.

## Signs and symptoms
- Hypotension, shock
- Impaired consciousness, coma
- Fever
- Vomiting, diarrhea
- Severe abdominal pain (which can resemble peritonitis)
