# Epidemiology

# Etiology
## Tertiary adrenal insufficiency
Tertiary adrenal insufficiency is caused by conditions that decrease CRH production.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The most common cause is sudden discontinuation of chronic glucocorticoid therapy.</span>
- Rarer causes include hypothalamic dysfunction (e.g., due to trauma, mass, hemorrhage, or anorexia): ↓ CRH → ↓ ACTH → ↓ cortisol release

# Clinical features
## Hypocortisolism
- Weight loss, anorexia
- Fatigue, lethargy, depression
- Muscle aches
- Weakness
- Gastrointestinal complaints (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)
- Sugar cravings
- (Orthostatic) hypotension
	- Glucocorticoids play an important role in catecholamine‑induced vasoconstriction and myocardial contractility.
### Lab findings
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypoglycemia </span>
	- Glucocorticoids inhibit peripheral glucose utilization and increase gluconeogenesis.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hyponatremia</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Glucocorticoids inhibit ADH secretion and thereby prevent excessive water retention. With adrenal insufficiency, ADH secretion is disinhibited causing increased reabsorption of free water with subsequent dilution hyponatremia.</span>

# Adrenal crisis
Adrenal crisis is an acute, severe glucocorticoid deficiency that requires immediate emergency treatment.
## Precipitating factors for adrenal crisis
- Stress in patients with underlying adrenal insufficiency e.g.:
	- Gastrointestinal illness (most common)
	- Other infections
	- Perioperative period
- Sudden discontinuation of glucocorticoids after prolonged glucocorticoid therapy 
- Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage or infarction (e.g., Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome)
- Pituitary apoplexy
>[!tip] 
>In order to prevent the development of secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency, prolonged steroid therapy should be tapered slowly rather than stopped abruptly.

## Signs and symptoms
- Hypotension, shock
- Impaired consciousness, coma
- Fever
- Vomiting, diarrhea
- Severe abdominal pain (which can resemble peritonitis)
