# Epidemiology
- Most common cause of [[hyperthyroidism]] in the United States

---
# Etiology
- Genetic predisposition
	- 50% of patients with Graves disease have a family history of autoimmune disorders (e.g., type 1 diabetes mellitus, Hashimoto disease, pernicious [[anemia]], [[myasthenia gravis]])
	- Associated with HLA-DR3 and HLA-B8 alleles
- Autoimmunity: B and T [[lymphocyte]]-mediated disorder
- Triggers
	- Infectious agents: Yersinia enterocolitica and Borrelia burgdorferi have been shown to trigger antigen mimicry for homologies between their protein constituents and thyroid autoantigens.
	- Stress 
		- Stress causes cortisol-mediated immune suppression, which is often <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">followed by rebound immunologic hyperactivity</span> and can trigger Graves disease in genetically susceptible individuals.
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Physical: surgery, trauma</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Psychological</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pregnancy</span>
		- Thyroid overstimulation by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">high levels of hCG and TRAb</span> during the first trimester increases the risk of Graves disease in the first trimester of pregnancy. In the second trimester, the risk decreases due to progesterone-induced immunosuppression. The risk of Graves disease increases postpartum in susceptible patients due to a drop in progesterone level which leads to the rebound of the immune system that can trigger autoimmunity.

# Pathophysiology
- General mechanism: B and T cell-mediated autoimmunity → production of stimulating immunoglobulin G <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">(IgG) against TSH-receptor (TRAb</span>; type II hypersensitivity reaction) → ↑ thyroid function and growth → [[hyperthyroidism]] and diffuse goiter
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy: activated B and T cells infiltrate retro-orbital space targeting orbital fibroblasts → cytokine release (e.g. TNF-α, IFN-γ) → local inflammatory response → fibroblast proliferation and differentiation to adipocytes → production of hyaluronic acid and GAGs and increased amount of adipocytes → increase in the volume of intraorbital fat and muscle tissues → exophthalmos, lid retraction, disturbances in ocular motility (causing diplopia)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pretibial myxedema: dermal fibroblast stimulation and deposition of glycosaminoglycans in connective tissue</span>
