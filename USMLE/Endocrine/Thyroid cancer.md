# Papillary thyroid carcinoma 
- Tissue of origin: Thyrocytes
- Well differentiated
- Characteristics
	- Most common type of thyroid cancer
	- Palpable lymph nodes due to metastatic spread (often detected before primary tumor)
	- May be multifocal
	- Very good prognosis
 - Pathology
	 - Psammoma bodies![[Pasted image 20231221165709.png]]
		- Morphology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">concentric lamellar calcifications</span>
		- Occurrence: seen in diseases associated with calcific degeneration
			- Papillary thyroid carcinomas (evidence of psammoma bodies in thyroid tissue should always raise suspicion of malignancy)
			- Serous papillary cystadenocarcinoma of ovary and endometrium
			- Meningiomas
			- Mesotheliomas
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">“Orphan Annie” eyes nuclei</span>
		- Morphology: empty-appearing large oval nuclei with central clearing
		- Occurrence
			- Papillary thyroid carcinomas
			- Autoimmune thyroiditis (e.g., Hashimoto disease, Grave disease)
# Medullary carcinoma
- Tissue of origin: Parafollicular cells (C cells)
- Poorly differentiated
- Characteristics
	- Sometimes a genetic predisposition → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2)</span> (25% of medullary carcinomas)
	- Sporadic (75% of medullary carcinomas)
	- Produces [[calcitonin]]
