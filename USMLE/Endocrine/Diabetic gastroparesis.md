# Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Poor glycemic control</span>, sustained hyperglycemia > 200 mg/dL → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">neuronal damage → impaired neural control of gastric function</span> (e.g., interstitial cells of Cajal dysfunction, abnormal myenteric neurotransmission, smooth muscle dysfunction, vagal dysfunction) → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">antral motor coordination and function abnormalities</span> (↓ antral contractions, pyloric spasms, abnormal antroduodenal contractions) → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">delayed gastric emptying</span>
