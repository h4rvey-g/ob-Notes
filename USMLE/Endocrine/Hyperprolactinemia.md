# Epidemiology

# Etiology
- Prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas (prolactinomas) 
- Damage to the hypothalamus and/or infundibular stalk
- Severe primary [[hypothyroidism]]: ↓ T3/T4 → ↑ TRH → ↑ prolactin
- Drugs
	- Dopamine antagonists: 
		- Antiemetics: metoclopramide, domperidone 
		- Antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone)
	- Certain tricyclic antidepressants: e.g., clomipramine
- Physiological causes: stress, pregnancy, lactation, nipple stimulation, crying baby, sexual orgasm, sleep, exercise

# Pathophysiology
- ↑ Prolactin → galactorrhea
- ↑ Prolactin → suppression of GnRH → ↓ LH, ↓ FSH → ↓ estrogen, ↓ testosterone → hypogonadotropic hypogonadism

# Clinical features
## Male
- ↓ Testosterone
	- Loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, infertility
	- Gynecomastia 
	- Reduced facial and body hair
	- [[Osteoporosis]]

>[!tip] 
>Patients with hyperprolactinemia due to a [[pituitary adenoma]] may also present with bitemporal hemianopsia and headache.
