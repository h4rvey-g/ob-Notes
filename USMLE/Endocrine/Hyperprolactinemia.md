# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Prolactin-secreting [[pituitary adenoma]] (prolactinomas) </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Damage to the hypothalamus and/or infundibular stalk</span>
	- They compress the infundibular stalk and result in an interruption of the tonic inhibitory effect of hypothalamic dopamine on the secretion of prolactin![[Pasted image 20231216164848.png]]
- Severe primary [[hypothyroidism]]: ↓ T3/T4 → ↑ TRH → ↑ prolactin
- Drugs
	- Dopamine antagonists: 
		- Antiemetics: metoclopramide, domperidone 
		- Antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone)
	- Certain tricyclic antidepressants: e.g., clomipramine
- Physiological causes: stress, pregnancy, lactation, nipple stimulation, crying baby, sexual orgasm, sleep, exercise

# Pathophysiology
- ↑ Prolactin → galactorrhea
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Prolactin → suppression of GnRH → ↓ LH, ↓ FSH → ↓ estrogen, ↓ testosterone → hypogonadotropic hypogonadism</span>

# Clinical features
## Male
- ↓ Testosterone
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, infertility</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gynecomastia</span> 
	- Reduced facial and body hair
	- [[Osteoporosis]]

>[!tip] 
>Patients with hyperprolactinemia due to a [[pituitary adenoma]] may also present with bitemporal hemianopsia and headache.
