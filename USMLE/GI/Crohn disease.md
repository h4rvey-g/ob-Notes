# Epidemiology
- Typical age of onset: bimodal distribution with one peak at 15–35 years and another one at 55–70 years
- Populations with higher prevalence
	- Individuals of Northern European descent
	- Individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent

---
# Etiology
- Risk factors [4]
	- Familial aggregation
	- Genetic predisposition (e.g., mutation of the NOD2 gene, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">HLA-B27 association</span>)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tobacco smoke</span>

>[!tip] 
>Nicotine consumption is the only (known) controllable risk factor for CD. Therefore, smoking cessation is especially important in patients with CD.

# Pathology
- Transmural inflammation: all mucosal layers of the intestinal wall are involved 
	- Noncaseating granulomas![[Pasted image 20231026112626.png]]![[Pasted image 20231026112648.png]]

# Clinical features
## Constitutional symptoms
- Low-grade fever
- Weight loss
- Fatigue
## Gastrointestinal symptoms
CD most <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">commonly affects the terminal ileum and colon</span>, but involvement of any part of the GI tract (from mouth to anus) is possible. In contrast to [[ulcerative colitis]], <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">rectal involvement is uncommon</span>. 
- Chronic diarrhea
- Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (uncommon)
	- microscopic (i.e., identified only on stool analysis) or overt
- Abdominal pain, typically in the RLQ
- Palpable abdominal mass  in the RLQ  
	- Due to adhesions within the intestine caused by inflammation![[Pasted image 20231026105145.png]]
- Features of CD complications
	- Malabsorption (e.g., weight loss, [[anemia]], failure to thrive)
	- Enterocutaneous or perianal fistulas, often associated with abscess formation
## Extraintestinal symptoms
- Joints
	- Enteropathic arthritis
- Eyes
	- Uveitis
	- Iritis
	- Episcleritis
- Oral mucosa
	- Oral aphthae
	- Pyostomatitis vegetans
- Skin
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Erythema nodosum</span>
	- Acrodermatitis enteropathica
	- Pyoderma gangrenosum: a neutrophilic dermatosis![[Pasted image 20231026110846.png]]
		- Associated with various conditions (e.g., IBD, [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and trauma)
		- Manifests with very painful, rapidly-progressive, red spots that can change into purulent pustules or deep ulcerated lesions with central necrosis
		- Commonly located at extensor side of the lower limbs
		- Treated with immunosuppressants (e.g., corticosteroids, cyclosporine A)

# Diagnostics
## Endoscopy
- Indication: all patients with suspected CD
	- Assesses the distribution and severity of the disease
	- Aids differentiation of CD from other diseases (e.g., [[ulcerative colitis]])
	- Monitors disease activity (e.g., active disease, remission)
	- Can be used therapeutically (e.g., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">stricture dilatation</span>)
- Supportive findings
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Skip lesions</span>: segmental and/or discontinuous pattern of involvement (interspersed with normal tissue)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Linear and/or serpiginous ulcerations </span>![[Pasted image 20231026112109.png]]
	- Small aphthous ulcerations 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cobblestone sign: inflamed edematous sections interspersed with deep ulcerations that resemble cobblestones</span> ![[Pasted image 20231026112246.png]]
	- Erythema, fissures, strictures, and fistulas

# Complications
## Fistulizing CD
- Occur in one-third of patients with CD
- Typically involve the perianal region![[Pasted image 20231026113426.png]]
## Other intestinal complications
- Colorectal cancer (especially in the case of pancolitis)
- Short bowel syndrome and associated issues after surgery
- Stenosis/strictures → bowel obstruction/(sub)ileus
- Intestinal perforation → peritonitis
- [[Primary sclerosing cholangitis]]
- Impaired bile acid reabsorption
	- Bile acid diarrhea 
	- Bile acid malabsorption → steatorrhea and deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins 
- Abscess formation/phlegmons
## Systemic complications
- Signs of malabsorption syndrome
	- Weight loss
	- Failure to thrive and growth failure in children
	- [[Anemia]]
		- Iron deficiency anemia
			- Caused by intestinal blood loss
		- Megaloblastic anemia (vitamin B12 deficiency due to impaired absorption in the chronically inflamed ileum)![[Pasted image 20231026112938.png]]
	- Osteoporosis
