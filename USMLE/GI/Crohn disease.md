# Epidemiology
- Typical age of onset: bimodal distribution with one peak at 15–35 years and another one at 55–70 years
- Populations with higher prevalence
	- Individuals of Northern European descent
	- Individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent

---
# Etiology
- Risk factors [4]
	- Familial aggregation
	- Genetic predisposition (e.g., mutation of the NOD2 gene, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">HLA-B27 association</span>)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tobacco smoke</span>

>[!tip] 
>Nicotine consumption is the only (known) controllable risk factor for CD. Therefore, smoking cessation is especially important in patients with CD.

# Pathophysiology


---
# Clinical features
## Constitutional symptoms [6]
- Low-grade fever
- Weight loss
- Fatigue
## Gastrointestinal symptoms [6]
CD most <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">commonly affects the terminal ileum and colon</span>, but involvement of any part of the GI tract (from mouth to anus) is possible. In contrast to [[ulcerative colitis]], <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">rectal involvement is uncommon</span>. 
- Chronic diarrhea
- Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (uncommon)
	- microscopic (i.e., identified only on stool analysis) or overt
- Abdominal pain, typically in the RLQ
- Palpable abdominal mass  in the RLQ  
	- Due to adhesions within the intestine caused by inflammation![[Pasted image 20231026105145.png]]
- Features of CD complications
	- Malabsorption (e.g., weight loss, [[anemia]], failure to thrive)
	- Enterocutaneous or perianal fistulas, often associated with abscess formation
## Extraintestinal symptoms
- Joints
	- Enteropathic arthritis
- Eyes
	- Uveitis
	- Iritis
	- Episcleritis
- Oral mucosa
	- Oral aphthae
	- Pyostomatitis vegetans
- Skin
	- Erythema nodosum
	- Acrodermatitis enteropathica
	- Pyoderma gangrenosum: a neutrophilic dermatosis![[Pasted image 20231026110846.png]]
		- Associated with various conditions (e.g., IBD, [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and trauma)
		- Manifests with very painful, rapidly-progressive, red spots that can change into purulent pustules or deep ulcerated lesions with central necrosis
		- Commonly located at extensor side of the lower limbs
		- Treated with immunosuppressants (e.g., corticosteroids, cyclosporine A)
