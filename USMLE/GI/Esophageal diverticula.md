# Pathophysiology
- Inadequate relaxation of the esophageal sphincter (e.g., caused by achalasia or spastic motility) and increased intraluminal pressure → outpouching of the esophageal wall → pulsion diverticulum
	- Usually a false diverticulum
	- Common sites
		- Upper esophageal sphincter (UES) → pharyngoesophageal pulsion diverticulum (e.g., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Zenker diverticulum</span>)
		- Lower esophageal sphincter (LES) → epiphrenic pulsion diverticulum
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Inflammation of the mediastinum with scarring and retraction</span> (e.g., secondary to tuberculosis or fungal infection) → traction diverticulum [5]
	- Usually true diverticulum
	- Common site: the middle esophagus
