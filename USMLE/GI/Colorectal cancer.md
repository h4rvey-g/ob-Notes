# Epidemiology
## Colorectal carcinogenesis pathways (molecular pathology) 
- Chromosomal instability pathway in colon cancer: The adenoma-carcinoma sequence is the progressive accumulation of mutations in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">oncogenes (e.g., KRAS) and tumor suppressor genes (e.g., APC, TP53)</span> that results in the slow transformation of adenomas into carcinomas.![[Pasted image 20231216095151.png]]
- Microsatellite instability pathway in colon cancer: due to methylation or mutations in mismatch repair genes (MMR genes, e.g., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">MLH1 or MSH2</span>), see [[Lynch syndrome]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">COX-2 overexpression</span>
	- Associated with colorectal cancer
	- Possible protective effect of long-term use of aspirin and other NSAIDs
