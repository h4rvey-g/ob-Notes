# Etiology
## Common causes of PUD
The two major contributing factors to the development of PUD are gastrointestinal infection with H. pylori and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Helicobacter pylori infection</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Associated with 40–70% of duodenal ulcers and 25–50% of gastric ulcers</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chronic NSAID use</span>
>[!tip] 
>Unlike aspirin and other NSAIDS, acetaminophen is believed to be safe for people with ulcers. It is inactivated peripherally. Since it doesn't thin the blood, it doesn't increase the risk of bleeding either.
## Associated risk factors
- Shared risk factors for PUD, GERD and gastritis (i.e., smoking, heavy alcohol use, glucocorticoids, caffeine)
## Rare causes of PUD
- Acid hypersecretory states
	- [[Gastrinoma|Zollinger-Ellison syndrome]]

# Diagnostics
### Indications for biopsy
- Gastric ulcers [20]
	- Biopsies are recommended in most cases. 
	- Multiple biopsies are recommended.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">From the edge and base of the ulcer</span> (essential to rule out malignancy, which is not uncommon in gastric ulcers)
		- The central part of the ulcer may contain necrotic tissue, fibrin slough, and other debris, which are typically not useful for diagnostic purposes.
	- Multiple biopsies from different areas of the stomach lining, including those not surrounding the ulcer (to test for H. pylori)
- Duodenal ulcers
	- Obtain biopsies from ulcers with endoscopic features that suggest malignancy.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Duodenal ulcers are usually benign and do not require routine biopsy.</span>

# Complications
## Peptic ulcer perforation
- Definition: full-thickness injury and loss of bowel wall integrity that results in leakage of gastrointestinal contents
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The second most common complication of PUD</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">PUD is the most common cause of GI perforation.</span>
- Etiology
	- Prepyloric gastric ulcers are the most common cause of perforation.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Duodenal ulcers of the anterior wall are more likely to perforate than ulcers of the posterior wall. </span>
		- This is because less protection is provided by the surrounding anatomical structures.
- Clinical features
	- Sudden, diffuse abdominal pain and rigidity
	- Fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension 
	- Pneumoperitoneum
	- Shoulder pain (irritation of the phrenic nerve)
