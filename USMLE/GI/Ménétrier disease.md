- Definition: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">gastritis featuring massive enlargement of the mucosal folds</span>
- Pathophysiology
	- Foveolar hyperplasia leads to:
		- Increased mucus production → loss of protein
		- Atrophy of parietal cells → decreased gastric acid production
		- Hyperplasia of gastric rugae
- Clinical features
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dyspeptic symptoms (i.e., abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss)</span>
	- Protein-loss gastropathy → hypoalbuminemia and peripheral edema
- Diagnostics: based on endoscopic and histopathological findings 
	- Endoscopic findings: prominent rugae in the gastric fundus ![[Pasted image 20231025145536.png]]
	- Histopathological findings: foveolar hyperplasia and parietal cell atrophy
