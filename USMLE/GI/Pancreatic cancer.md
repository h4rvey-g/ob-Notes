- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Smoking (strongest risk factor) </span>
	- Considered to be one of the leading causes of pancreatic cancer and associated with an up to 6-fold increase in the risk of developing malignancy.  
- Chronic pancreatitis (especially when present for more than 20 years)
- High alcohol consumption 
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus
## Endogenous risk factors
- Age > 50 years
- Inherited genetic syndromes (10% of pancreatic cancers)
	- Familial atypical multiple mole melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome
	- Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations)
	- HNPCC
	- Von-Hippel-Lindau syndrome
	- Neurofibromatosis type 1
	- Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1

# Clinical features
## Hypercoagulability
