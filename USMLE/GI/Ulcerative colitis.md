# Epidemiology
- Higher in White populations than in Black, Hispanic, or Asian populations
- Highest among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent
- 15–35 years of age

# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Genetic predisposition (e.g., HLA-B27 association)</span>
- Ethnicity (White populations, individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Protective factors: smoking</span>
	- The pathophysiology is not fully understood, as smoking has negative effects on other inflammatory diseases (e.g., Crohn disease).

# Pathophysiology
![[Pasted image 20230918172226.png]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dysregulation of intestinal epithelium</span>: increased permeability for luminal bacteria  → activation of macrophages and dendritic cells → antigen presentation to macrophages and naive CD4+ cells
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dysregulation of the immune system</span>: upregulation of lymphatic cell activity (T cells, B cells, plasma cells) in bowel walls → enhanced immune reaction and cytotoxic effect on colonic epithelium → inflammation with local tissue damage (ulcerations, erosions, necrosis) in the submucosa and mucosa
	- Autoantibodies (pANCA) against cells of the intestinal epithelium
- Pattern of involvement
	- Ascending inflammation that begins in the rectum and spreads continuously proximally throughout the colon 
	- Inflammation is limited to the mucosa and submucosa.
 
 >[!tip] 
>Unlike ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease is characterized by transmural inflammation.

>[!tip] 
>The rectum is always involved in ulcerative colitis.

# Clinical features
- Intestinal symptoms
	- Bloody diarrhea with mucus
	- Fecal urgency
	- Abdominal pain and cramps
	- Tenesmus
- Extraintestinal symptoms of ulcerative colitis
	- General: fatigue, fever
	- Skeletal (most common extraintestinal manifestation of ulcerative colitis): [[osteoarthritis]], ankylosing spondylitis, sacroiliitis
	- Ocular: uveitis, episcleritis, iritis
	- Biliary: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[primary sclerosing cholangitis]] (it is rare for patients with ulcerative colitis to develop [[Primary sclerosing cholangitis|PSC]], but up to 90% of all patients with [[Primary sclerosing cholangitis|PSC]] will also have ulcerative colitis)</span>
	- Cutaneous
		- Erythema nodosum
		- Pyoderma gangrenosum
		- Aphthous stomatitis

>[!tip] 
>[[Primary sclerosing cholangitis|PSC]] is often associated with inflammatory bowel disease, especially ulcerative colitis. However, only approximately 4% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease develop [[Primary sclerosing cholangitis|PSC]].
