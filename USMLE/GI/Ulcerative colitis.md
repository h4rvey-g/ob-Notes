![[Pasted image 20230918172226.png]]
- Pattern of involvement
	- Ascending inflammation that begins in the rectum and spreads continuously proximally throughout the colon 
	- Inflammation is limited to the mucosa and submucosa.
 
 >[!tip]

	- Fecal urgency
	- Abdominal pain and cramps

	- Skeletal (most common extraintestinal manifestation of ulcerative colitis): osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, sacroiliitis
	- Ocular: uveitis, episcleritis, iritis
	- Biliary: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">primary sclerosing cholangitis (it is rare for patients with ulcerative colitis to develop PSC, but up to 90% of all patients with PSC will also have ulcerative colitis)</span>
	- Cutaneous
		- Erythema nodosum
		- Pyoderma gangrenosum
		- Aphthous stomatitis
