- **Parietal Cells**: They are larger and have a distinct, round or triangular shape. Their cytoplasm appears eosinophilic (pinkish) due to the abundance of mitochondria. The nucleus is centrally located and often round.
- **Chief Cells**: These are smaller, and their shape is more columnar or cuboidal. They have basophilic (blue/purple) cytoplasm because of the high concentration of rough endoplasmic reticulum necessary for enzyme secretion. The nuclei of chief cells are typically basal.
