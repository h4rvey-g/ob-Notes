## Active viral hepatitis
- Eosinophilic single-cell necrosis (Councilman bodies) 
	- An eosinophilic remnant of apoptotic hepatocytes seen on liver biopsy. Associated with yellow fever and viral hepatitis.![[Pasted image 20231017214001.png]]
- Bridging necrosis
## Chronic viral hepatitis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Interface hepatitis (piecemeal necrosis) </span>
	- Periportal liver cell necrosis with lymphocytic infiltration![[Pasted image 20231017214520.png]]
	- The cause of interface hepatitis is a CD8 T-cellâ€‘induced hepatocyte apoptosis.
	- Indicates chronic active hepatitis and poor prognosis
- Fibrous septa   [30]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ground glass hepatocytes (Characteristic for HBV)</span>
	- Hepatocytes with swollen transparent cytoplasm due to hyperplasia of the endoplasmic reticulum resulting in a ground glass appearance![[Pasted image 20231017214542.png]]![[Pasted image 20231017214547.png]]
	- Pathognomonic for hepatitis B

- Breastfeeding may be started immediately if there are no contraindications (e.g., cracked or bleeding nipples), regardless of whether individuals:
	- Have HBsAg positive or unknown status
	- Are receiving antiviral therapy
