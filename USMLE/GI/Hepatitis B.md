## Active viral hepatitis
- Eosinophilic single-cell necrosis (Councilman bodies) 
	- An eosinophilic remnant of apoptotic hepatocytes seen on liver biopsy. Associated with yellow fever and viral hepatitis.![[Pasted image 20231017214001.png]]
- Bridging necrosis
## Chronic viral hepatitis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Interface hepatitis (piecemeal necrosis) </span>
	- Periportal liver cell necrosis with lymphocytic infiltration![[Pasted image 20231017214520.png]]
	- The cause of interface hepatitis is a CD8 T-cellâ€‘induced hepatocyte apoptosis.
	- Indicates chronic active hepatitis and poor prognosis
- Fibrous septa   [30]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ground glass hepatocytes (Characteristic for HBV)</span>
	- Hepatocytes with swollen transparent cytoplasm due to hyperplasia of the endoplasmic reticulum resulting in a ground glass appearance![[Pasted image 20231017214542.png]]![[Pasted image 20231017214547.png]]
	- Pathognomonic for hepatitis B

# Pathophysiology
## Replication cycle of HBV
HBV carries a DNA polymerase with both DNA and RNA-dependent functions, also known as reverse transcriptase (RT).![[Pasted image 20231217151303.png]]
1. After entering the host cell's nucleus, reverse transcriptase completes the positive strand of the virus's partially double-stranded relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA).
2. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The rcDNA is converted to covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA)</span> primarily by host enzymes in a process that is not entirely understood.
3. The cccDNA is then transcribed into viral mRNA by host RNA polymerase.
4. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The viral mRNA leaves the nucleus and is translated into HBV core proteins and new reverse transcriptase in the cytoplasm.</span>
5. Viral mRNA and reverse transcriptase are packaged into a capsid, where viral mRNA is then reverse-transcribed into viral rcDNA.
6. New viral DNA genomes are enveloped and leave the cell as progeny virions.

# Diagnostics
- Chronic infection (inactive): HBsAg (+), Anti-HBc (+, IgG), Anti-HBe (+)![[Pasted image 20231213111859.png]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Recovery: conversion from HBsAg (+) to Anti-Hbs (+) in chronic infection, also HBV DNA needs to be undetectable</span>

## Perinatal Hep B
![[Pasted image 20231029112500.png]]
- Breastfeeding may be started immediately if there are no contraindications (e.g., cracked or bleeding nipples), regardless of whether individuals:
	- Have HBsAg positive or unknown status
	- Are receiving antiviral therapy
