- Flatulence, abdominal bloating, and pain
## Extraintestinal symptoms and associations
- **Malabsorption symptoms**: fatigue, weight loss, vitamin deficiency, iron deficiency [[anemia]], osteoporosis, hypocalcemia
- In children: failure to thrive, growth failure, delayed puberty, secondary [[hyperparathyroidism]]
- Dermatologic associations: **dermatitis herpetiformis**

# Diagnostics
## Laboratory studies
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG IgA): initial test</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Total IgA</span>
	- Indicated for all patients because of the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">high prevalence of IgA deficiency in patients with celiac disease</span> (approx. 2â€“3%)
	- If patients have low IgA, perform further IgG-based testing.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Deamidated gliadin peptide</span>
	- IgG-based testing: indicated in IgA deficiency or discordant biopsy and serology
		- IgG-tissue transglutaminase (tTG IgG)
		- IgG deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP IgG)
	- IgA-based testing: IgA deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP IgA)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anti-endomysial antibody (EMA): Potential second-line confirmatory test (high-specificity)</span>
## Endoscopy
- EGD with small intestine biopsy (confirmatory test)
	- Intraepithelial lymphocytic infiltration
	- Crypt hyperplasia
	- Villous atrophy
