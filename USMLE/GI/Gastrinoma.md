# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gastrinomas are assumed to arise from endocrine cells of the gut (mostly the duodenum) or the pancreas. </span>
- Most gastrinomas occur sporadically (∼ 75% of cases). [2]
- Some gastrinomas occur in association with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) (∼ 25% of cases).

# Pathophysiology
- Gastrinomas are neuroendocrine tumors of the GI tract that secrete gastrin. 
- Hypergastrinemia → stimulation of parietal cells → gastric acid hypersecretion, which leads to:
	- Peptic ulcer disease
	- Inactivation of pancreatic enzymes → diarrhea, steatorrhea → malabsorption
		- The high volume of gastric acid that is produced <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decreases intestinal pH.</span> <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pancreatic lipases, which require an alkaline environment to function, are inactivated and can no longer emulsify fats.</span> Moreover, gastrin acts directly on the intestine and prevents sodium and water reabsorption, resulting in secretory diarrhea.

# Clinical features
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most patients manifest with recurrent, therapy-resistant peptic ulcer disease. </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Abdominal pain</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Diarrhea and steatorrhea</span>
- Dyspeptic symptoms (e.g., heartburn)
- Upper gastrointestinal bleeding 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Weight loss </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Possible symptoms of other endocrine neoplasias.</span>
