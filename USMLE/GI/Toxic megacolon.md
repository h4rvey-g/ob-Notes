# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Bacterial: C. difficile (pseudomembranous colitis), Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter infections
- Inflammatory colitis: Ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease

---
# Pathophysiology
- Colonic accumulation of inflammatory mediators and bacteria → nitric oxide synthesis → colonic dilation [16]
- Edema and inflammation of the colonic smooth muscle → colonic dysmotility → colonic dilation

---
# Clinical features
- (Bloody) diarrhea and vomiting
- Abdominal distention and pain
- Signs of sepsis (fever, tachycardia, hypotension) and dehydration

---
# Diagnostics
- Abdominal x-ray findings 
	- Dilation of the colon (transverse colon diameter > 6 cm)
	- Loss of haustration 
	- Multiple air-fluid levels
