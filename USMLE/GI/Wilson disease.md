# Pathophysiology
- Autosomal recessive mutations in the ATP7B gene (Wilson gene) on chromosome 13, which encodes for a membrane-bound, copper-transporting ATPase → defective ATP7B protein [4]
	- Reduced incorporation of copper into apoceruloplasmin  → ↓ serum ceruloplasmin
	- Reduced biliary copper excretion 
- Results in ↑ free serum copper → accumulation in the liver, cornea, CNS (basal ganglia, brain stem, cerebellum), kidneys, and enterocytes
