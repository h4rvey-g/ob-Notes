# Pathophysiology
Inflammation and progressive destruction (likely due to an autoimmune reaction) of the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">small and medium-sized intrahepatic bile ducts (progressive ductopenia)</span> → defective bile duct regeneration → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">chronic cholestasis</span> → secondary hepatocyte damage due to increased concentration of toxins that typically get excreted via bile → gradual portal and periportal fibrotic changes → liver failure → liver [[cirrhosis]] and portal hypertension (in advanced stage)

# Treatment
## General principles
- Start pharmacotherapy with ursodeoxycholic acid for all patients.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Offer supportive care, including management of cholestasis-associated pruritus.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Liver transplantation is necessary if liver [[cirrhosis]] is advanced.</span>
## Pharmacotherapy
- First-line: ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA, ursodiol): a hydrophilic, nontoxic bile acid with immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, choleretic, and cytoprotective effects
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Slows disease progression</span> and development of complications (e.g., esophageal varices)
	- Prolongs transplant-free and overall survival
	- Also used in [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]], cholestasis of pregnancy, and small cholesterol stones
