- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Liver transplantation is necessary if liver cirrhosis is advanced.</span>
## Pharmacotherapy
- First-line: ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA, ursodiol): a hydrophilic, nontoxic bile acid with immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, choleretic, and cytoprotective effects
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Slows disease progression</span> and development of complications (e.g., esophageal varices)
	- Prolongs transplant-free and overall survival
	- Also used in primary sclerosing cholangitis, cholestasis of pregnancy, and small cholesterol stones
