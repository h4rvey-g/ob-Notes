- Descriptions
	- NAFLD: non-alcohol related accumulation of fat in the liver cells
	- NASH: NAFLD with chronic inflammation and damage of liver cells
- Epidemiology: very widespread
- Etiology
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Obesity and/or type 2 [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] (metabolic syndrome)</span>
		- Due to excess supply of nutrients in the liver
- Pathophysiology: ↑ Insulin resistance 
	- ↑ Hepatic uptake of fatty acids
	- ↑ Triglyceride synthesis
	- ↑ Peripheral lipolysis
- Clinical features 
	- Often asymptomatic
	- Hepatomegaly
	- May progress to [[cirrhosis]] 
- Diagnostics
	- ↑ Transaminases (AST/ALT ratio < 1): The reversal of the AST/ALT ratio to values > 1 may indicate progression to [[cirrhosis]]. 
	- Rule out other causes of chronic hepatitis (e.g., heavy alcohol use, [[hepatitis B]], [[hepatitis C]], [[Wilson disease]], autoimmune hepatitis, [[hemochromatosis]], α1-antitrypsin deficiency)

- Pathology
	- Hepatocellular lipid accumulation, mostly macrovesicular
