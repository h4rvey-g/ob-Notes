# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Inherited susceptibility: primarily autosomal dominant with reduced penetrance
	- ∼ 50% of cases: associated with a mutation in the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RYR-1)
- Triggering agents
	- Volatile anesthetics (except nitrous oxide)
	- Succinylcholine

# Pathophysiology
- Administration of triggering substances → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">calcium release from intracellular compartments or delay in its reuptake → ↑ calcium in muscle cells → ↑ contractility of the skeletal muscle → ↑ metabolism → ↑ oxygen consumption in addition to ↑ CO2 production, heat, and lactate (malignant hyperthermia) → mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis → uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation → breakdown of the cell's energy supply → cell death</span>
>[!tip] 
>Smooth muscle and cardiac muscle remain unaffected.
