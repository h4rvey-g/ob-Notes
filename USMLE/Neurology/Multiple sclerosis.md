Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic degenerative disease of the CNS characterized by demyelination and axonal degeneration in the brain and spinal cord, which are caused by an immune-mediated inflammatory process.
# Epidemiology
- Sex: ♀ > ♂ (3:1) [1]
- Age of onset: 20–40 years of age [2]
- Ethnicity: ↑ prevalence among the white and black population [3]
- Prevalence: 50-300 per 100 000 people (greater among people who live further from the equator)

# Etiology
The etiology of multiple sclerosis is unclear; it is believed to develop in genetically predisposed people who have been exposed to certain environmental factors.
- Environmental risk factors [2][6]
	- Low vitamin D levels (insufficient intake, decreased exposure to UV radiation)

# Pathophysiology
- Pathophysiology of MS is characterized by autoimmune inflammation, demyelination, and axonal degeneration.
- Most commonly accepted theory: Activation of autoreactive T-lymphocytes  → inflammatory processes → focal demyelination with partial preservation of axons (acute plaques) → loss of axons and atrophy of oligodendrocytes (chronic plaques) → gliosis  → inadequate remyelination
- B-[[lymphocyte]] dysfunction: The following suggests that B-lymphocytes play a role in the pathogenesis of MS, although the exact mechanism of their involvement is unclear.
	- Anti-CD20 agents (ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, rituximab) are effective in preventing exacerbations. 
	- Presence of tertiary lymphoid organs in the meninges of individuals with secondary progressive MS  [14]
	- Intrathecal synthesis of IgG (oligoclonal bands; see “Diagnostics” section for more information)
- Progressive phenotypes (forms) of MS are characterized by [15]
	- Chronic inflammation that occurs with an intact blood-brain barrier and is driven by immune cells compartmentalized in the leptomeninges and perivascular spaces
	- Accelerated compared to relapsing-remitting phenotype brain atrophy

# Clinical features
- Optic neuritis
	- Most often the earliest manifestation
	- Typically unilateral
	- Can be painful
	- Impaired vision and color blindness
	- Relative afferent pupillary defect (Marcus Gunn pupil)
- Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) as a result of a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) 
	- Ipsilateral medial rectus weakness but an intact convergence reflex
	- Disconjugate, lateral gaze nystagmus in the contralateral eye
	- More frequently bilateral than unilateral
- Demyelination of spinal cord tracts
	- Lhermitte sign: a shooting electric sensation that travels down the spine upon flexion of the neck 
	- Pyramidal tract lesion: upper motor neuron weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, positive Babinski sign, impaired gait
	- Dorsal spinal column lesion: loss of vibration and fine-touch sensation, numbness, paresthesias, sensory ataxia usually involving the trunk or one or more limbs 
	- Neuropathic pain
	- Absent abdominal reflex
- Cerebellar involvement: poor postural control, imbalance, gait dysfunction, Charcot neurological triad of scanning speech, nystagmus, and intention tremors 
- Transverse myelitis
	- Asymmetric paraplegia, unilateral sensory loss, bladder dysfunction
	- Partial transverse myelitis is a common early manifestation of MS, causing asymmetric neurologic dysfunction below the lesion.
- Cranial nerve palsies: diplopia, facial palsy, trigeminal neuralgia (can be bilateral)  [20][21]
	- Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) typically manifests unilaterally.
	- Bilateral TN should raise concern for MS, especially in younger patients. 
- Autonomic dysfunction: bowel and bladder neurogenic disorders (e.g., [[urinary incontinence]]), impaired sexual function 
- Changes in mental state: depression, emotional changes, memory deficits, impaired concentration 
- Uhthoff phenomenon: a reversible exacerbation of neurological symptoms following an increase in body temperature, e.g., physical exertion, a warm bath, or fever

>[!tip] 
>MS is a chronic condition that typically manifests in a relapsing-remitting form characterized by episodic CNS dysfunction (exacerbations) with at least partial recovery between episodes.
