Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic degenerative disease of the CNS characterized by demyelination and axonal degeneration in the brain and spinal cord, which are caused by an immune-mediated inflammatory process.
# Epidemiology
- Sex: ♀ > ♂ (3:1) [1]
- Age of onset: 20–40 years of age [2]
- Ethnicity: ↑ prevalence among the white and black population [3]
- Prevalence: 50-300 per 100 000 people (greater among people who live further from the equator)

# Etiology
The etiology of multiple sclerosis is unclear; it is believed to develop in genetically predisposed people who have been exposed to certain environmental factors.
- Environmental risk factors [2][6]
	- Low vitamin D levels (insufficient intake, decreased exposure to UV radiation)

# Pathophysiology
- Pathophysiology of MS is characterized by autoimmune inflammation, demyelination, and axonal degeneration.
- Most commonly accepted theory: Activation of autoreactive T-lymphocytes  → inflammatory processes → focal demyelination with partial preservation of axons (acute plaques) → loss of axons and atrophy of oligodendrocytes (chronic plaques) → gliosis  → inadequate remyelination
- B-[[lymphocyte]] dysfunction: The following suggests that B-lymphocytes play a role in the pathogenesis of MS, although the exact mechanism of their involvement is unclear.
	- Anti-CD20 agents (ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, rituximab) are effective in preventing exacerbations. 
	- Presence of tertiary lymphoid organs in the meninges of individuals with secondary progressive MS  [14]
	- Intrathecal synthesis of IgG (oligoclonal bands; see “Diagnostics” section for more information)
- Progressive phenotypes (forms) of MS are characterized by [15]
	- Chronic inflammation that occurs with an intact blood-brain barrier and is driven by immune cells compartmentalized in the leptomeninges and perivascular spaces
	- Accelerated compared to relapsing-remitting phenotype brain atrophy
