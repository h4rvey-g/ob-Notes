# Pathophysiology
- Nontraumatic mechanisms of hemorrhage
	- Chronic arterial hypertension → lipohyalinosis of lenticulostriate vessels (which supply the basal ganglia) and/or formation and rupture of Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysms → lacunar strokes (ischemia) of the basal ganglia
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Putamen most commonly affected</span>![[Pasted image 20231224102741.png]]
		- Other locations: thalamus (second most common) and infratentorial parts of the brain (e.g., pons, cerebellum)
	- Cerebral amyloid angiopathy: deposition of β-amyloid peptides in vessel walls → focal damage with formation of microaneurysms → rupture → recurrent lobar intracerebral hemorrhage
- Traumatic: blunt or penetrating injury → damage to vessels

# Clinical features
- Headache
- Focal neurologic signs and symptoms
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Putaminal hemorrhage: contralateral hemiparesis or hemiplegia with less severe contralateral hemisensory loss; eyes deviate toward the side of the hematoma </span>
		- Thalamic hemorrhage: contralateral hemiparesis, contralateral hemisensory loss, decreased consciousness, wrong way eyes
- Course
	- Symptoms typically progress gradually over minutes to a few hours
	- Focal deficits worsen with expansion of the hematoma
	- Late: symptoms of increased ICP
		- Nausea and vomiting
		- Confusion and loss of consciousness
		- Bradycardia
		- Fixed pupils
