# Pathophysiology
- Nontraumatic mechanisms of hemorrhage
	- Chronic arterial hypertension → lipohyalinosis of lenticulostriate vessels (which supply the basal ganglia) and/or formation and rupture of Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysms → lacunar strokes (ischemia) of the basal ganglia
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Putamen most commonly affected</span>
		- Other locations: thalamus (second most common) and infratentorial parts of the brain (e.g., pons, cerebellum)
	- Cerebral amyloid angiopathy: deposition of β-amyloid peptides in vessel walls → focal damage with formation of microaneurysms → rupture → recurrent lobar intracerebral hemorrhage
- Traumatic: blunt or penetrating injury → damage to vessels
