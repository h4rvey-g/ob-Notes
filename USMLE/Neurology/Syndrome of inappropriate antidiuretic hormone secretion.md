# Pathophysiology
- ↑ ADH secretion → receptor-mediated signaling cascade in the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts of the kidneys → build-up of additional water canals (aquaporin-2) in the luminal cell membrane
- Water is drawn out of the urine and into the hyperosmolar kidney tissue → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">concentration of urine and ↑ [[urine osmolality]]</span> (becomes higher than serum osmolality)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Water retention → ↓ serum osmolality with transient volume expansion → ↑ ANP, ↑ BNP, and ↓ aldosterone → ↑ urinary sodium and water excretion → euvolemic hyponatremia</span>
- Osmotic fluid shifts → cerebral edema and ↑ intracranial pressure (may occur in patients with extremely low Na+ levels)
