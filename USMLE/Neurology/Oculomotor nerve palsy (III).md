# Epidemiology

# Etiology
## Basilar segment
The basilar segment is the only region where the oculomotor nerve is not accompanied by other cranial nerves.
### Cause
- Aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery
### Clinical features
- Headache
- Paralytic squint
- Pupillary involvement: nonreactive, dilated pupil (blown pupil)
>[!tip] 
>Parasympathetic fibers of CN III are located superficially and motor fibers are located centrally. Parasympathetic fibers are more susceptible to compressive lesions (e.g., uncal herniation, aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery). Motor fibers are more susceptible to ischemia (e.g., [[Vasculitides|vasculitis]], [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], atherosclerosis).

# Pathophysiology


---
# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Horizontal diplopia</span> that worsens when the head is turned away from the side of the lesion 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ptosis </span>
	- Due to levator palpebrae superioris muscle weakness
- Light sensitivity

# Diagnostics
- Assessment of extraocular muscle function : Lesions of the motor portion typically produce paralytic squint. 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Down-and-out gaze: affected eye looks outwards (exotropia) and downwards (hypotropia) </span>
		- This type of squint occurs because of the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">action of the lateral rectus muscle and the superior oblique muscle</span>, and it is only seen in individuals with isolated oculomotor nerve palsy.
	- Adduction weakness
- Assessment of pupillary response (afferent: CN II; efferent: CN III) 
	- Lesions of the autonomic (parasympathetic) portion result in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">loss of the pupillary reflex.</span>
