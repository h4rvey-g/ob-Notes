# Pathophysiology
All patients with Meniere disease have impaired endolymph resorption that results in endolymph hydrops.
- Endolymph hydrops: accumulation of fluid in the endolymphatic sac.
- Rupture theory: fluid accumulation in the endolymphatic sac → tear in the Reissner membrane  → increased perilymphatic potassium → depolarization of the afferent acoustic nerve fibers → symptom onset
- Compression theory: impaired endolymph resorption → compression of the semicircular canals  → symptom onset
