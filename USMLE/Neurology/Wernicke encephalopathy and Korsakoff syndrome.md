# Pathophysiology
- [[Vitamin B1|Thiamine]] deficiency → decreased cerebral glucose metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">depleted ATP and increased free radicals → injury of neuronal elements</span> (e.g., myelin sheaths, blood-brain-barrier, decreased neurotransmitters, etc.) → impaired axonal conduction → symptoms of Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome
- In patients with Korsakoff syndrome: long term [[Vitamin B1|thiamine]] deficiency → permanent damage to components of the limbic system (e.g., mammillary bodies, anterior thalamic nuclei) → atrophy of these components → memory loss, apathy, and disrupted emotional processing

# Clinical features
## Wernicke encephalopathy (acute, reversible)
- Should be suspected in any patient with a history of chronic heavy alcohol use who presents with one/more symptoms of the<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> classic triad of Wernicke encephalopathy</span> 
	1. Confusion (most common) 
		- Disorientation, impaired vigilance, and cognitive deficits
	2. Oculomotor dysfunction 
		- Due to involvement of the CN III, CN IV, and CN VI nuclei
		- Gaze-induced horizontal/vertical nystagmus (most common)
		- Diplopia 
		- Conjugate gaze palsy
	4. Gait ataxia: wide-based, small steps
