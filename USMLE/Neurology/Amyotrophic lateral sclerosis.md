a neurodegenerative disease with upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction.
# Epidemiology
- Mean age of onset is 65 years.

---
# Etiology


---
# Pathophysiology
Classically affects the entire motor neuron system at two or more levels (both upper and lower motor neuron degeneration).

---
# Clinical features
## General disease characteristics
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Both upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs are present</span> (see Upper motor neuron injury vs. lower motor neuron injury)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Constant disease progression</span>: it usually starts in one arm and/or leg then progresses to the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">contralateral side</span>
## Early symptoms
- Symptoms are highly variable and potentially non-specific (e.g., subtle vocal changes or difficulties grasping objects)
- Asymmetric limb weakness, often beginning with weakness in the hands and feet 
- Bulbar symptoms such as dysarthria, dysphagia, and tongue atrophy (20% of cases at disease onset)
- Pseudobulbar palsy with pseudobulbar affect may develop.
- Fasciculations, cramps, and muscle stiffness
- Weight loss
- Split hand sign: a wasting pattern in which the muscles of the thenar eminence atrophy due to degeneration of the lateral portion of the anterior horn of the spinal cord
## Late symptoms
- Cognitive impairment (approx. 15% of ALS patients meet the criteria for frontotemporal dementia)
- Autonomic symptoms (e.g., constipation, bladder dysfunction) may develop; the mechanism of development is unclear. [1]
- Life-threatening symptoms
	- Respiratory failure due to paralysis of respiratory muscles
	- Dysphagia due to bulbar weakness or pseudobulbar palsy

---
# Differential Diagnosis
- [[Myasthenia gravis]]
	- Weakness improves with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
	- No UMN or LMN signs


---
# Treatment
- Riluzole
	- A sodium-channel blocker that inhibits glutamate release in the CNS and decreases glutamate excitotoxicity
	- Prolongs survival and slows functional decline in patients with ALS (on average, for 3 months) [1]
- Edaravone
	- A free radical scavenger 
	- Has been shown to slow functional decline in some patients with ALS
