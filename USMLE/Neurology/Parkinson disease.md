- Progressive dopaminergic neuron degeneration in the substantia nigra (part of the basal ganglia) and the locus coeruleus → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Neurotransmitters|dopamine]] deficiency at the respective receptors of the striatum with interrupted transmission to the thalamus and motor cortex → motor symptoms of PD</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Neurotransmitters|Serotonin]] and noradrenaline depletion (in the raphe nuclei): likely cause of depressive symptoms</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[Neurotransmitters|Acetylcholine]] surplus (in the nucleus basalis of Meynert): likely cause of dyskinesia</span>

- Lewy bodies
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Aggregates of misfolded α-synuclein and other proteins</span>, such as ubiquitin and neurofilament protein within the neural cell bodies
	- Appear histologically as <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">intracellular hyaline eosinophilic globules</span>
	- May be found in brainstem, substantia nigra, and cortex
	- Also seen in Lewy body dementia

- Image A: An eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion (Lewy body; blue overlay) is visible inside a neuron. There is a large accumulation of neuromelanin (brown granules; green overlay).
- Image B: A neurite staining positive for α-synuclein is visible in the center of the image (Lewy neurite; yellow overlay).

# Treatment
## Nonergot dopamine receptor agonists
- Pramipexole, Ropinirole, Apomorphine
- Consider as initial treatment in younger patients, especially those with risk factors for levodopa-induced dyskinesia.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Some patients develop impulse control disorders with compulsive gambling or hypersexuality.</span>
