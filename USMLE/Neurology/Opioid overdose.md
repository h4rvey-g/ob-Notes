# Clinical features
## Opioid toxidrome
The classic triad consists of:
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Altered mental status (e.g., CNS depression, euphoria)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bilateral miosis (pinpoint pupils)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Opioid-induced respiratory depression</span>
>[!warning] 
><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The absence of miosis does not rule out opioid overdose</span> as hypoxia, co-ingested drugs (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines), and/or medications (e.g., atropine) may cause mydriasis, thereby counteracting the miotic effect of opioids.
## <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD)</span>
- ↓ Respiratory rate and/or apnea
- ↓ Tidal volume
>[!warning] 
>OIRD is the most common cause of death from opioid overdose and is treated with naloxone for opioid overdose.
