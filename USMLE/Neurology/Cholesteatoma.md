# Pathophysiology
Keratinizing squamous epithelium grows from the tympanic membrane or the auditory canal into the middle ear mucosa or mastoid air cells.
- Congenital cholesteatoma
	- Present at birth
	- Embryonic nests of epidermal cells that remain in the middle ear
- Acquired cholesteatoma (more common)
	- Primary: eustachian tube dysfunction → tympanic membrane epithelium retracts inwards → retraction pocket
	- Secondary: Epithelium migrates inwards through a perforation in the tympanic membrane, which is commonly caused by recurrent/chronic otitis media.
